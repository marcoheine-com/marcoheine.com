There are a lot of great blogs, newsletters, tools, websites out there about
Fronted Development. In this blog post I'd like to present you my favorite
**frontend links and bookmarks** which I'm using daily or at least weekly.

I won't categorize them, so this will not be a list of my favorite blogs only,
for example, or my favorite github projects. It will be more like the best
link-list (for me personally) of every category. Also the list itself will not
be in any ranking, I'll just present them to you in a random order.

You'll also be able to find my Frontend Bookmarks on
[GitHub](https://github.com/marcoheine-com/frontend-bookmarks), so please feel
free to make **suggestions** to this list with your own favorite bookmarks and
links. One goal of this blog post will be to get my own list growing as I'm
always looking forward to find new blogs or newsletters about Frontend
Development. Enough with the introduction, let's take a look at my Frontend
Bookmarks.

### <a name="mdn"></a> Mozilla Developer Network

The [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) is my
number one visited website currently. It's my central station. It's not only the
biggest and best up to date **documentation** about **web technologies**, it
also offers awesome **articles** and **guides** to learn more about HTML, CSS,
JavaScript, DOM, Web APIs and many more.

I just use it for everything. I use it to look up CSS properties, learn more
about how certain JavaScript methods work and to find out what attributes belong
to a specific HTML element.

If I google a specific frontend problem I usually start with "mdn ..." because
I've always found a solution there. Mozilla recently started the
[Learning web development](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn) section
which "aims to provide complete beginners to web development with all they need
to start coding simple websites".

So if you get stuck anywhere, MDN always explains a solution, if you want to
learn more about CSS Layout, HTML audio and video or anything similar, MDN is
the place to go.

My **favorite article** on **MDN** is
[A re-introduction to JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript).
If you're new to JavaScript or want to re-learn or look up the core concepts, I
highly recommend this article.

### <a name="caniuse"></a> CanIUse

Do your ask yourself daily "Oh I want to use this new CSS property or this HTML
element, but does it work already in Internet Explorer, Opera or in any Android
Browser?" If you've answered yes, I have a solution for you. The website
[caniuse.com](http://caniuse.com/) does this job for you.

You just have to browse there, type in a property or element and CanIUse
provides you up-to-date **browser support tables** for support of front-end web
technologies on desktop and mobile web browsers.

It's also separated by the different versions of every browser, shows the
current published version, browser usage and specific notes, known issues and
resources. So it's not only showing you, which browser supports what, it is also
telling you, why one browser doesn't support this specific CSS property yet.

Great tool I don't want to miss! There is also a CanIUse Node.js module which
let's you look up browser support from the command line.
[David Walsh](https://twitter.com/davidwalshblog) wrote a small
[blog post](https://davidwalsh.name/caniuse-command-line) about it.

### <a name="pagespeed-insights"></a> PageSpeed Insights

**PageSpeedInsights** is a great tool I already mentioned and explained in my
[Website Performance Optimization blog post](https://marcoheine.com/blog/website-performance-optimization/)
so I won't talk that much about it here and just give a brief summary.

You just enter the URL of the website you'd like to test and PageSpeedInsights
loads the page on a small screen and on a big screen, analyzes **what's good and
what's bad** on the website and additionally gives very useful advice on how to
do better.

As I said I've explained this in depth in my blog post so I'd suggest you head
over there if you're interested in learning more about PageSpeedInsights.

### <a name="codepen"></a> CodePen

[CodePen](http://codepen.io/) quotes itself as a "Playground for the front end
web" and I think this describes it perfectly. In short, it's a **code editor in
the browser**. You can quickly write HTML, CSS and JavaScript there and
immediately see the output.

It even got a console recently so it's now also possible to debug JavaScript. I
often use it to quickly try out new HTML, CSS features or **prototype something
really quickly** because this is its biggest advantage: It's fast and you get
the result immediately.

It gets new features and updates recently so you can not only play around with
simple HTML, CSS and JavaScript, you can also use HTML Preprocessors like Haml
or Markdown, CSS Preprocessors like Sass, integrate Normalize.css, add external
CSS, add popular JS libraries like jQuery or add external JS.

Another great thing I love about CodePen is its **collaborative thinking**. You
can share or work together on a "Pen" very easy, you can integrate a "Pen" into
your website like I did on this
[blog post](https://marcoheine.com/blog/new-css-layout/) and you can browse Pens
of others to get inspired or learn something new. I love to browse on CodePen
daily and see everyday the impressive and amazing work of other developers.

### <a name="github"></a> GitHub

I think I don't have to write that much about [GitHub](https://github.com/)
here, it's a very well known service and I guess every developer used it once or
at least heard of it. I think one of the best ways to learn to code is to look
at and inspect other peoples code and that's what I love about GitHub.

You get the possibility to **browse the code of your favorite libraries**,
technologies and tools and get an insight of how these people build their
software. The other great opportunity GitHub features is, of course, OSS.

Everybody is encouraged to contribute to famous projects. I have to admit that I
did not dare to contribute a PR so far, but it's definitely a big thing on my to
do list. I also really like the GitHub
[explore section](https://github.com/explore) where you can find and browse new
projects.

### <a name="css-tricks"></a> CSS-Tricks

I guess I know about [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) since I made my first
real steps in web development back when I did my bachelors degree. Originally
its articles contained **real CSS tricks** but this changed so now it covers
tricks for almost every section in web development! I really like CSS-Tricks for
their **great articles and tutorials**. They are also the creators of
[CodePen](http://codepen.io/).

One of my favorite articles on CSS-Tricks is
[Front End Development is Development](https://css-tricks.com/front-end-development-is-development/)
by Geoff Graham where he explains why some people argue that Front End
Development should not be considered "real development" and why this is just
wrong. It's a great summary of all the aspects a Frontend Developer has to deal
with and it clearly shows that we are "real" developers.

Another article, which I think is really one of the best on CSS-Tricks, was
recently published by Chris Coyier and is called
[A Front End Developer is Aware](https://css-tricks.com/front-end-developer-aware/).
It just starts off, where the other article stopped and explains the position of
a Frontend Developer and why we have to be aware of everything.

"In a general sense, the front end developer is positioned in the middle of lots
of other jobs. Everybody involved in a web team ends up talking with the front
end developers. That makes sense. The front end developers create the actual
thing people interact with. Everything comes together with the front end
developer.

Perhaps that's why it's such a fun job! Because the front end developer is this
central hub position and dealing with lots of different people doing lots of
different jobs, the job can be done better if they are aware. Aware of
everything else that makes a website tick."

I really recommend reading this article and again that's exactly what I like so
much about CSS-Tricks.

### <a name="smashing-magazine"></a> Smashing Magazine

When I wanted to discover more web development resources,
[Smashing-Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/) wasn't really hard to
find. It's one of the **biggest** and **most important blogs** about frontend
development and in my opinion it's a place where the best and most researched
articles are published.

Compared to other blogs its articles are not short posts or tutorials - they
usually dig a lot **deeper** and explain further contexts. Next to their well
researched articles Smashing Mag also publishes the
[Smashing Book](https://shop.smashingmagazine.com/products/smashing-book-5-real-life-responsive-web-design).

The latest published book, Smashing Book 5, is about "Real-Life Responsive Web
Design" and I highly recommend it. It covers various topics concerning
Responsive Web Design like Responsive Workflow, Design Patterns and Components,
SVG, Flexbox, Testing and Debugging and many more.

On top of that, Smashing Mag organizes a great series of **conferences**: the
[Smashing Conference](http://smashingconf.com/). I wasn't able to attend one so
far but it's definitely on my to do list.

### <a name="reddit"></a> Reddit JavaScript & Learn JavaScript

Of Course you have heard of **reddit**, the "front page of the internet". I use
a lot of subreddits and for that reason I really like the
[JavaScript](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/) and
[Learn JavaScript](https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJavaScript) subreddits.

I try to check them out daily because you'll always find interesting **links,
projects or tools** there or learn something new. Additionally a lot of people
present their projects there attached to some problems they would like to
overcome and it's really fun to read these stories and help them trying to
figure out a solution.

So the JavaScript and Learn JavaScript Reddit pages are great places to get your
**daily dose of JavaScript**. If you're interested in more JavaScript links,
especially focused on learning I'd like to point you to my
[JavaScript learning resources](https://github.com/marcoheine-com/javascript-learning-resources)
GitHub repository at this point. I think it's a great collection of resources
I've used and am using right now to dig deeper into JavaScript.

### <a name="newsletter"></a> Newsletter

Besides online documentation, blogs or tools for frontend development I'm a big
fan of **newsletters**. I really like the idea that someone sends me an awesome
list weekly, where he or she carefully collected the best and most informative
links of the week about any frontend development topic.

Sometimes I already got across the most links but this doesn't matter, mostly
there is always something **new to learn** and **discover**. So far I'm
regularly reading the following three newsletters:

[JavaScript Weekly](http://javascriptweekly.com/) which is obviously all about
JavaScript, [Frontend Focus](http://html5weekly.com/), formerly HTML5 weekly,
which is more like a web platform technology roundup and last but not least the
[Web Development Reading List](https://wdrl.info/). This one is also published
on the Smashing Magazine website.

What I really like about this newsletter is, that's it is seperated in different
sections like concept & design, tools & workflows, privacy, javascript, css/sass
and many more.

### <a name="conclusion"></a> Conclusion

So this is it - these are my **favorite frontend bookmarks**, as I explained at
the beginning: in a complete random order and without categorization. It's not a
big list and I definitely want it to **grow**!

So if you've got any link to a blog, tool, newsletter, project etc. concerning
frontend development, I'd love to check it out and add it to my collection. Feel
free to drop me an email or directly contribute on
[GitHub](https://github.com/marcoheine-com/frontend-bookmarks).
