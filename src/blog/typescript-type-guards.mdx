  'TypeScript type guards are a way to narrow down the type of a variable and make sure to prevent errors'

In a recent project I’ve used TypeScript Type Guards so much that I wanted to write a blog post about them with great examples and why I like them so much. They’ve helped me a lot to prevent errors and make my code more safe and reliable.

## <a name="what-are-typescript-type-guards"></a> What are TypeScript Type Guards
TypeScript Type Guards are used when you only want to allow a certain type in a function or block of code. You want to make sure that a variable is of a certain type.

Because only this certain type has the values you want to work on from there. If you'd use a certain function or a block of code with a type who would be missing the values you want to work on, you would run into errors.
