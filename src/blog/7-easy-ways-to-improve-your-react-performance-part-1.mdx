import { Link } from 'gatsby';

At the beginning of the year I wrote a blog post about <Link to='/blog/react-performance-improvements/'>React performance improvements</Link>. Itâ€˜s one of my favourite blog posts I ever wrote. Itâ€™s a great example of **documenting everything while you learn it**.

Itâ€™s a very in depth analysis. It shows you how to **test and measure** the performance of your React application and a lot of ways how to improve it.

In the contrary this blog post has the goal to give you a lot of **quick wins** for your performance. Things you can change and adjust, without too much effort.

So you can see it as an **addition** to my original react performance blog post. The first one builds the foundation. This one adds the cherry on top.

This post is **part 1** of a **series**.

Part 2: _Coming Soon_

**What you can learn from this blog post:**

- [One useState hook instead of multiple for connected data](#useState)

## <a name='keys'></a> Always use a key when mapping (and not an index)

When mapping over an array and rendering a list of items, make sure you **always use keys** for every item.

Keys help React identify which items have **changed, are added, or are removed**. Keys should be strings that identify a list item, such as an ID.

Here is a quick example of the usage of keys. Check the return method of this component. There we use the id of every animal as a key.

```javascript
import * as React from 'react';
import { AnimalCard } from './animal-card';

const animals = [
  {
    id: 1,
    name: 'dog',
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    name: 'cat',
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    name: 'unicorn',
  },
];

const Animals = () => {
  return animals.map(animal => {
    return <AnimalCard key={animal.id}>{animal.name}</AnimalCard>;
  });
};

export default Animals;
```

If you're not using keys, React has to a hard time to figure out which items to update. This can lead to updating every item although only one changed.

This can be a massive performance impact! ðŸ˜«

If you don't have access to unique identifiers, indexes can be used as a last resort. It is **not recommended** to use them as keys but it's better than not using any keys at all.

If the order of items changes, the index changes as well so React has to update every item anyway.

You can learn more about why keys are important in this [article about reconciliation](https://reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html#recursing-on-children).

So that's it for quickwin number one: **always use a key when mapping!**

## <a name='fragments'></a> Use React.Fragments instead of divs as JSX parent element

Next up: quickwin number two.

When you return multiple elements from a component, JSX needs a parent element to wrap them. A quick way to do this, is to put a `<div>` around them.

I admit it, I've done this too, way too many times.

```javascript
import * as React from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <span>Hi!</span>
      <span>Hope you can learn a lot from my blog posts</span>
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

But the next time you need a JSX wrapping element, think again! You can use a **React.Fragment** for that!

```javascript
import * as React from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <React.Fragment>
      <span>Hi!</span>
      <span>Hope you can learn a lot from my blog posts</span>
    </React.Fragment>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

And the best thing is, there is even a **short syntax** for this.

```javascript
import * as React from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <span>Hi!</span>
      <span>Hope you can learn a lot from my blog posts</span>
    </>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

But wait, why does this boost my performance? Good question! Here's the thing. The more DOM elements your React application has, the **longer** the render process takes.

Google's performance tool lighthouse recommends **not more than 1500 DOM nodes** in total.

So by removing every unnecessary `div`, like the one we've used way too often as a JSX parent element wrapper, we already get closer to that goal. And we can boost our performance!

You can read more about why you should avoid too many DOM nodes in this article: [https://web.dev/dom-size/](https://web.dev/dom-size/)

<CoffeeHint />

## <a name='useState'></a> One useState hook instead of multiple for connected data

Another performance quickwin you can achieve easy, is using one `useState` hook instead of multiple ones for connected data.

Imagine a developer built a form with several `input` elements. Therefore they added four individual `useState` hooks.

That could look something like this:

```javascript
import * as React from 'react';

const MyBigForm = () => {
  const [username, setUsername] = React.useState('');
  const [email, setEmail] = React.useState('');
  const [password, setPassword] = React.useState('');
  const [nickname, setNickName] = React.useState('');

  const handleUserNameChange = event => {
    setUsername(event.target.value);
  };

  const handleEmailChange = event => {
    setEmail(event.target.value);
  };

  const handlePasswordChange = event => {
    setPassword(event.target.value);
  };

  const handleNicknameChange = event => {
    setNickName(event.target.value);
  };

  return (
    <form>
      <label>Username:</label>
      <input value={username} name="username" onChange={handleUserNameChange} />

      <label>Email:</label>
      <input value={email} name="email" onChange={handleEmailChange} />

      <label>Password:</label>
      <input value={password} name="password" onChange={handlePasswordChange} />

      <label>Nickname:</label>
      <input value={nickname} name="nickname" onChange={handleNicknameChange} />
    </form>
  );
};
```

There is a lot of `useState` and `onChange` going on here, right? Phew. We can optimize for the better here!

By **removing** the individual `useState` hooks and implementing a combined one, we're making sure to **reduce** the size of the component and therefore improve the performance.

And we can also get rid of all the `handleChange` functions, which all seem to do the same.

```javascript
import * as React from 'react';

const MyBigForm = () => {
  const [formdata, setFormdata] = React.useState({
    username: '',
    email: '',
    password: '',
    nickname: '',
  });

  const handleOnChange = event => {
    setFormdata({
      ...formData,
      [event.target.name]: event.target.value,
    });
  };

  return (
    <form>
      <label>Username:</label>
      <input value={username} name="username" onChange={handleOnChange} />

      <label>Email:</label>
      <input value={email} name="email" onChange={handleOnChange} />

      <label>Password:</label>
      <input value={password} name="password" onChange={handleOnChange} />

      <label>Nickname:</label>
      <input value={nickname} name="nickname" onChange={handleOnChange} />
    </form>
  );
};
```

Wow a lot less code and a lot more **readable**, don't you think? It's always a good idea to keep your state in an object, if you're dealing with **connected data**.

Don't get me wrong: using and calling multiple `useState` hooks is not a bad thing! React has no problem with that.

But in this example it's also about **removing duplicate code** and **rethinking** your components.

And if JavaScript has to allocate the memory for only one function instead of four, that's also a **performance quickwin**! And that's what we're here for, right?

That's it for **part 1** of this **React performance quickwins series**! Hope you could already apply some of them and make your React app even faster.
