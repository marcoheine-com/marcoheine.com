## <a name='avoid-anonymous-funcs'></a>Avoid anonymous functions

It's easy to use an anonymous function when you want to add a quick callback
function to a component.

```jsx
import * as React from 'react'

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <button onClick={() => console.log('Button clicked')}>Click me!</button>
  )
}

export default MyComponent
```

But if you're on the lookout for a quick performance win, that's something you
can avoid.

Anonymous functions arenâ€™t assigned an identifier like const/let/var. This means
they **are not persistent** whenever this functional component gets rendered
again. So JavaScript has to **create them again and again** on every re-render.

This becomes a problem, if you're rendering a loooot of elements, like a lot of
table cells, which all make use of an anonymous function.

There is an easy way to solve this. You can simply change it to a **named
function**.

```jsx
import * as React from 'react'

const MyComponent = () => {
  const handleClick = () => {
    console.log('Button clicked')
  }

  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me!</button>
}

export default MyComponent
```

That's it for quickwin number 4: avoid anonymous functions!

## <a name='defining-objects'></a>Define objects outside of your component

Here comes quickwin number 5. Something similar as described above can be
applied to objects.

If you define an object as a object literal and pass it in as props, this object
will have to be recreated on every rerender.

```jsx
import * as React from 'react'

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div style={{ textAlign: 'center', fontSize: '14px' }}>
      This is the text of my component.
    </div>
  )
}

export default MyComponent
```

Instead define your object outside of the component. Now it is created once on
the initial render and not being touched on every rerender.

```jsx
import * as React from 'react'

const DIV_STYLES = {
  fontSize: '14px',
  textAlign: 'center',
}

const MyComponent = () => {
  return <div style={DIV_STYLES}>This is the text of my component.</div>
}

export default MyComponent
```

Performance quickwin whoop whoop! ðŸš€

## <a name='lazy-suspense'></a>React.lazy and React.Suspense

With `React.lazy` you can "lazy load" your components. This means your component
is only rendered when it is truly needed and not loaded unnecessarily.

The less you need to load, the better your performance!

This can easily be combined with React.Suspense for rendering some fallback
content.

I wrote a whole Today-I-learned post about this topic, check it out here:
[Today I learned: React Suspense lazy-loading](/today-i-learned/react-suspense-lazy-loading)

That's also a great way to improve your react performance without too much
effort.

## <a name='virtualized-lists'></a>Virtualized lists

If you've ever worked with long lists or tables with a lot of rows in React you
know how much this can impact your performance. You have to render a lot of
content, usually a lot of divs.

We already learned that too much DOM nodes is not a good idea. Also updates and
rerenders can be really painful because they take just way too long.

With virtualized lists only the list items get rendered, that are actually in
the viewport. That's pretty cool. But how does this work? Don't worry, you won't
have to build this yourself. There are already amazing tools out there which do
the job for you.

Check out [react-virtualized](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized) by
Brian Vaughn.

It's pretty easy to use and you don't need to worry about displaying long lists
and tables anymore.

So that's it, these are my **7 easy ways to improve your React performance**.
