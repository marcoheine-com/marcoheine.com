In this blog post I’m gonna share all the mistakes I made, using React. Lately
there is a lot of dicussions going on around using Reacts useEffect. See my
Today-I-learned posts
[missusing useEffect](/today-i-learned/missusing-use-effect/) and
[data fetching in React 18](/today-i-learned/data-fetching-in-react-18/).

The React team published a brand new documention on using React, which is
fantastic. It’s still in beta but I could already refresh a lot of my knowledge.
The best part of the documentation is the following section: <a href="https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect" target="_blank">you might not need an effect &#8599;</a>.

It’s a whole page on when to not use useEffect and how to use useEffect. It has
so many great real-world examples. I noticed immediately that I use a lot of
patterns which were not the best way to solve things.

This made me realize I need to <a href="https://twitter.com/Mkuehb/status/1542426932448567296" target="_blank">adjust my best practices for react &#8599;</a>.
In this blog post I’m gonna share everything I thought I did right when using
React. But noticed now, I can solve it in a better way, according to the new
react docs.

### <a name="updating-state-based-on-props-or-state"></a>Updating state based on props or state

A common pattern I often used, was updating state when specific props changed. I
almost always used an effect for this. Listen when this props change, fire the
effect, update it. Guess what: You don’t need an effect for that! It’s
unnecessary! And, as I learned now: inefficient! To quote the react docs:

> "When something can be calculated from the existing props or state, don’t put
> it in state. Instead calculate it during rendering."

Don’t ❌:

```jsx
// ...

const [street, setStreet] = React.useState('main street')
const [zipcode, setZipcode] = React.useState('70180')

const [fullAdress, setFulladress] = React.usestate('')

React.useEffect(() => {
  setFulladress(`${street} ${zipcode}`)
}, [street, zipcode])

// ...
```

Do ✅:

```jsx
// ...

const [street, setStreet] = React.useState('main street')
const [zipcode, setZipcode] = React.useState('70180')

const fullAdress = `${street} ${zipcode}`

// ...
```

<br />

### <a name="dont-use-useeffect-for-expensive-caching"></a>Don’t use useEffect for expensive caching

In this example we get three values as props, and based on them run an effect.
Inside this effect we run a function to sort our data and set it into state.

Don’t ❌:

```jsx
const MyProfile = ({ name, lastname, hobbies }) => {
  const [contactDetails, setContactDetails = useState(null)

	useEffect(() => {
		setContactDetails(getContactSortedByHobbiesAndName(name, lastname, hobbies)
	}, [name, lastname, hobbies]
}
```

This is, again, unnecessary and inefficient. We shouldn’t use useEffect to cache
something like that. We don’t need to! We can remove the state, the whole
useEffect and once more calculate this value during render!

Do ✅:

```jsx
const MyProfile = ({ name, lastname, hobbies }) => {
  const contactDetails = getContactSortedByHobbiesAndName(
    name,
    lastname,
    hobbies
  )
}
```

As you may have already noticed, this is almost the same pattern as in the first
example. But the React docs add another improvement to it. Imagine our function
here is doing some expensive filtering by comparing thousands of rows. With a
small adjustion we can add free caching to that, without using useEffect!

Even better ✅✅:

```jsx
const MyProfile = ({ name, lastname, hobbies }) => {
  const contactDetails = useMemo(() => {
    return getContactSortedByHobbiesAndName(name, lastname, hobbies)
  }, [name, lastname, hobbies])
}
```

By adding useMemo we can cache this expensive filter or sort operation. It tells
React that it does not need to re-run the inner function unless name, lastname
or hobbies changes.

### <a name="use-a-cleanup-function"></a>Use a cleanup function when doing a fetch in useEffect

I already talked a bit about how I used useEffect wrong in a today-i-learned
post. The key takeaways from this were, that data fetching in react works, but
you need a cleanup function. Otherwise you will face race conditions.

A classic data fetching in useEffect example, which I’ve done a lot, could look
like this:

Don’t ❌:

```jsx
const Searchbar = ({ searchTerm }) => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null)

  useEffect(() => {
    const response = fetchFromSearchAPI(searchTerm)
    const data = response.json()
    setData(data)
  }, [searchTerm])
}
```

There is one big problem here. If a user triggers this search a few times and
kicks off separate fetches, there is nothing implemented to handle stale
responses. This might result in “wrong” results, which is a race condition. As
the react docs put it: two different requests “raced” against each other and
came in a different order than you expected.

The best way to fix this, is to add a cleanup function:

Do ✅:

```jsx
const Searchbar = ({ searchTerm }) => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null)

  useEffect(() => {
    let reset = false
    const response = fetchFromSearchAPI(searchTerm)
    const data = response.json()

    if (!reset) {
      setData(data)
    }

    return () => {
      reset = true
    }
  }, [searchTerm])
}
```

This ensures, React will only take the last response from the API and your
component will avoid race conditions.

### <a name="avoid-passing-data-to-the-parent"></a>Avoid passing data to the parent

Another pattern I used almost every time when working in a React project is
passing data from the child to the parent. Imagine you have a child component,
which fetches some data. You pass a callback function to it as props to get the
data to the parent.

Don’t ❌:

```jsx
const Header = () => {
	const [data, setData] = useState(null)

	return (
		<SearchBar
			onChange={setData}
		/>
	)
}

const Searchbar = ({ onChange }) => {

	const data = fetchSearchResults()

	useEffect(() => {
		if (data) {
			onChange(data)
		}

	}, [onChange, data]
}

```

This pattern seems weird at first. But it helped me for several specific use
case a lot, where it made sense to me to fetch the data in the child component.
But the obvious improvement here is to lift state up.

Do ✅:

```jsx
const Header = () => {
  const data = fetchSearchResults()

  return <Searchbar data={data} />
}

const Searchbar = ({ data }) => {
  // ...
}
```

The data gets fetched in the parent component and then passed down to the child
component. As the <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html" target="_blank">React docs &#8599;</a>
put it: React is all about one-way data flow down the component hierarchy. Makes
error tracing a lot easier. Even though there were some arguments for the child
data fetching, it’s always better to lift it up.

<br />

### <a name="conclusion"></a>Conclusion

There are a lot of key take aways from this article. The main thing, that got
stuck in my head is, to think twice whenever I write useEffect in the future. In
most cases I don’t need to! The other key take aways are:

- if it’s possible, calculate something during render and not in an effect
- you don’t need effects to transform data for rendering
- if your code should run because it should be displayed to the user, use an
  effect
- if you fetch data deep down in your component tree, but the parent also needs
  this state, lift it up
- if you want to fetch data in an useEffect, add a cleanup function

The new react docs talk about a lot more situations where you might not need an
effect, with better examples and even some challenges for you. It’s awesome that
they took the time to write something so detailed and helpful. I’m glad I could
rethink some patterns which I thought were the best practices.

Grab a cup of coffee (or your favorite beverage) and take your time to read
through it: <a href="https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect" target="_blank">you might not need an effect &#8599;</a>.
It’s so worth it and I learned a lot.
