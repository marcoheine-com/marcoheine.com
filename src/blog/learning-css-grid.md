I really liked the [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) course by [Wes Bos](https://twitter.com/wesbos) where you get to code 30 different projects with plain JavaScript. Now he published another course which is also available for free. This time it's all about learning [CSS Grid](https://cssgrid.io/). In this blogpost I will document everything I learned about CSS Grid in the course.
