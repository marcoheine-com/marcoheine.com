I’ve started working as a **freelance web developer** in february 2022 and so
far it’s been a lot of fun. Helping people to get their content, product or
services online feels very **rewarding**. On the other hand it often feels like
having **three jobs at the same time**. So improving processes plays a major
role in getting better at freelancing.

## <a name='improving-the-process'></a> Improving the process

After my first few client projects I noticed that a lot of the requirements are
the same and I keep **copy and pasting code** from one project to another.

Additionally the setup process of a new project often was the same. This brought
me to the point where I saw the case for a having an (almost) blank page to kick
things off, a white label, a website starter kit.

Note: Of course I know that this is not a big deal and I guess every developer
has their own templates to get started.

But nevertheless I wanted to write about my starter kit, the main parts of it
and what worked best for me so far. To reflect on my decisions and also gain
insights from others and what works best for them.

## <a name='the-main-parts'></a> The main parts

So here it is, my
[website starter kit](https://github.com/marcoheine-com/website-starter-kit).

It’s basically a setup of

- NextJS with TypeScript,
- TailwindCSS for styling
- Prismic as a headless CMS with pre-modeled and pre-built components
- Linting with eslint and prettier

With this setup I’ve already accomplished a lot of different use cases for
client projects.

From basic one-pagers, to landing pages with a handful of subpages, to big
corporate pages with dozens of subpages and web app features like filtering,
sorting, searching, connecting to a database, multiple API routes and
integrating different third-party services.

I have the feeling that this starter kit is ready for all of it and whenever I
start a new client project now, I just use it as a base and get started from
there real quick.

Without thinking or taking the time to setup and install dependancies. This
feels really cool.

### NextJS with TypeScript

**NextJS** is just so easy and fun to use, the documentation is fantastic and
all the sites I build with it are super fast, using the static generation
approach. So this was a no-brainer.

But I have to say, after playing a bit with [Remix](https://remix.run/) I’m
hoping it will get more popular and get a Prismic integration one day.

I can totally imagine switching NextJS for Remix, because it makes things even
easier and more natural.

### TailwindCSS

I’ve read all the discussion around TailwindCSS and I understand some of them.
At the end of the day I’m so much faster when I use Tailwind for styling in
comparison to styled-components, which I’ve used for all my projects before.

### Prismic

The market for headless CMS is huge and I could fill a whole page just about
them. I’ve tried a few and I liked Prismic the most. This is based on their
content modeling approach with custom types and slices.

But it is also mainly based on their editor interface. I have the feeling that
this is more accessible than others for non developers and this is a major
selling point for me.

But this starter kit does not only contain the integration part of prismic as a
CMS. It also has pre-modeled and pre-built components, that almost every website
uses. Like header, footer, menu or text-image.

### Linting with eslint and prettier

No one wants to manually format code. I’ve worked in a project years ago where
there was no automated code formatting and it was horrible. Hours spent by
setting code on the same line. Ugh.

So integrating eslint together with prettier is a no-brainer. Renaming
variables, forgetting one file and you get errors and don’t know why. Not
anymore with basic linting done by eslint.

That’s it, thats my website starter kit, the foundation from what I start all my
projects right now. I’m really curious when I’m going to change things here and
how long I’m going to use this.

What is your stack? What technologies are you using all the time together? I’m
really curious to know! Send me an [email](mailto:marco@marcoheine.com) with
your thoughts on this.
