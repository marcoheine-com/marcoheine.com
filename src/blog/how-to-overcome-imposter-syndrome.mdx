I was in a comfortable position at a previous job. I was working as a frontend
developer and after two years in this job, I knew my way around. I knew about
every feature our product contained. I knew the code. I could tell which
component was responsible for what.

I knew where most of the questions at me where headed before someone finished
them asking. This felt like home. This felt like the absolute **comfort zone**.

After switching jobs imposter syndrome hit me hard. At first I felt like a
**fraud**. Everything was new to me. The code, the tools, the workflow, the
people, the team. I felt like I had to relearn everything. And like I did not
know anything at all.

I always thought that sooner or later somebody would come to me and say: "You
know, we've watched you long enough and now you've been caught. You don't know
anything about software developing." _handcuffs click._

Did you ask yourself questions like **am I good enough**? Do you often have
thoughts like do I know enough to be a good developer? Can I help make this
product better? My skills are way to bad. **I should quit. I know nothing**.

This kind of thoughts are bad and not helpful at all you could say. But still a
lot of people have them.

Chances are you've felt the same at some point in your career. Chances are you
will feel like that everytime you start a new job. This all sounds very
negative. But the good news is: **you are not alone**!

A colleague of mine once told me that they should take two weeks off to learn a
specific technology. Because they feel like they "know nothing about it". And
they are developers, I **learn the most of** and look up to. In my eyes they
know their stuff pretty well.

If anything of this above sounds familiar to you, let me tell you about the
imposter syndrome.

<br />

### <a name="definition"></a> What is imposter syndrome?

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome) gives a very good
definition of imposter syndrome:

> _Impostor syndrome (also known as impostor phenomenon, impostorism, fraud
> syndrome or the impostor experience) is a psychological pattern in which an
> individual doubts their accomplishments or talents and has a persistent
> internalized fear of being exposed as a "fraud"._

If this sounds familiar to you, chances are you also feel like you **do not
deserve** certain things. You think your achievements are not you own and your
success is attributed to **luck**.

For some people it gets even worse. Often **anxiety, stress or depression** go
along side with imposter syndrome.

<br />

### <a name="why"></a> Why you feel like an imposter

So the questions is why do we feel this way? What **causes** imposter syndrome?
It does not sound like something that could benefit our work, our life or
anything between. It sounds harmful and could also hold as back.

A lot of developers are **self taught**. Often they suffer from imposter
syndrome because they do not have a CS degree. And this is still required by a
lot of companies. Thus they think, they are not "real" developers, if they
haven't learned their stuff at a university.

Another reason why we feel this way is that the web industry is one of the
**fastest changing industries**. Every week or so this new technology gets
popular. A new JavaScript framework will replace the most popular one right now
and you need to know about it and have learned about it yesterday. Which is
obviously not possible.

So we get the feeling we need no know everything but we can't. And we don't
accept the obvious reasons, we think we as developers, as humans are the
problem.

There is always something new to learn in this industry. This is on the one hand
a really nice thing and motivates me but but it's hard to stay on top.

Every programming task you do at work is like a small challenge. If you succeed
everything is fine. But if you don't find a solution right away you question
yourself. You **question your knowledge** and if you've even **capable** of this
job.

We compare ourselves to others. This new kid just joined the company and already
build this super complex feature. Because they are programming since they are 12
years old. I will never be as good as them. Sounds familiar?

<br />

### <a name="why-not"></a> Why you aren't an imposter

Let's take a quick break and a deep breath.

Let me tell you that you took the first step. We analyzed the problem and we saw
the situation for what it really is. There are a lot of ways to grow out of it
and change. From here on the positive takes over.

**You are not an imposter** because you do not need a CS degree to be a good
developer. It can help in some ways but the knowledge to be a good developer is
not only trapped inside a CS degree.

**You are not an imposter** because take a look. See how far you've come. What
you've achieved in your past, all you've done. Even if you're a beginner
remember all the things you've learned so far, even the smallest.

My incredibly talented wife draw this beautiful picture about this topic.

I take a look at it as often as I can because it's always a **good reminder**.

**You are not an imposter** because you've got the job right? You convinced
someone to hire you as a developer. That's a big achievement you can't fake.

**You are not an imposter** because remember this one little crazy bug you
solved which seemed like "a hell no we will never solve this bug at all". But
you did.

**You are not an imposter** because you don't know everything. And that's
totally fine. **You can't know everything**. And even if you could, that would
be really boring, right? One of the greatest things in life is that there is
always something new to learn.

### <a name="overcoming"></a> Overcoming imposter syndrome

Now as we have set the clear picture why you are not an imposter, here are more
tips on how to deal with imposter syndrome and eventually **overcome** it.

<CoffeeHint />

#### <a name="realistic-goals"></a> Set yourself realistic goals

Set yourself some realistic goals! Telling yourself that in three weeks you will
know the entire codebase by heart is an impossible goal. Rather set up smaller
goals which are **clear** and **measurable**.

<br />

#### <a name="track-accomplishments"></a> Keep track of your accomplishments

Write down everything you achieved. Even the smallest things. Everytime you
struggle, you doubt yourself, take a look at that list. Be proud of what you've
learned and achieved. This helps a lot.

<br />

#### <a name="dont-compare"></a> Don't compare yourself to others

Comparing yourself to others is never a good idea. It always leaves you feel bad
about yourself. You don't know the history of others, how they learn and how
they think. Everyone is different and has their own strengths and weaknesses.

The next time you compare yourself to the new team member, who already seems to
know everything - stop right there. Be happy for the new colleague because they
settled so quickly.

Than **compare yourself to you** from last week or last month. There are
definitely things you've learned, features you built and bugs you crushed.

<br />

#### <a name="teammates"></a> Your teammates and colleagues may feel the same

Talk to your colleagues about it. Chances are they feel exactly they same as you
do. Help to build a culture in your company where it's easy and desired to share
knowledge. Where you help each other and not knowing everything is considered
normal. Do more pair programming and knowledge sharing sessions.

Learn to be brave and answer questions with: "I don't know an answer to your
question right away. I need to think about it first." I know this seems very
hard, but in the end everyone benefits from that.

Finally be aware of the fact that the work and achievements as a team is, what
counts.

<br />

#### <a name="feedback"></a> Ask for Feedback

If you're feeling like an imposter remember that the only person you get
feedback from right now is yourself. To stop this cycle and get a more realistic
view of what is really happening, don't hesitate to ask your teammates and
colleagues for feedback! They can give you valuable answers on how you're really
doing and where you can improve.

<br />

#### <a name="experts"></a> Even the experts in our industry feel this way

When I came across [this blog post](https://davidwalsh.name/impostor-syndrome)
by David Walsh, I was astonished. He writes a lot of blog posts about the
JavaScript ecosystems. He worked for Mozilla for over 8 years. Developers go to
his blog to get help, read his tutorials and learn stuff. And even he feels this
way. This shows a whole new perspective. Take your time and head over there to
read this. I'll wait here.

And than you'll see that you're absolutely not alone feeling like this. You're
fine.

### Conclusion

Dealing with imposter syndrome can be hard and your are not alone in this. The
first step is to realize that you suffer from it. From there on you can grow
into a more healthy relationship with yourself. There are a lot of tools you can
use to cope and deal with imposter syndrome.

I hope I could explain this topic a little better and you can use my tips to
overcome imposter syndrome.
