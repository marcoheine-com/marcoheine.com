I can't believe I'm actually writing this but CSS container queries are coming!
ðŸ¥³ ðŸŽ‰

At some point I stopped counting the times when I was building a website layout
and came to a point where I needed to adapt an element **depending on the size
of it's container**.

This was just **impossible** to do with CSS.

The time has finally come where this will change!

[Check out the draft for it here](https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/5796).

It's still in a draft status but no matter what, this means css container
queries are coming and these are some exciting news!

I'm already looking forward to the time when we can use this in production!
