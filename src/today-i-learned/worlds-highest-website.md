Today I learned that there exists something like the <a href="https://worlds-highest-website.com/" target="_blank">&#8599; worlds highest website</a>.

It's exactly 18.94 kilometers high, wow! You can scroll it for ages. I'm not sure how long it takes to scroll to the bottom. 

The most interesting fact to me is, how fast you can get to the bottom by using a standard anchor tag with an id link to a div at the bottom. It happens in just a blink of an eye. 

The website consists of just one HTML container with pure CSS styling and has a height of 2840 em. What a great idea, I would have never thought of trying to build the highest website. 

It's also interesting to see that Firefox starts shrinking the main container as soon as the website gets higher than 18.939583 kilometers.
