              I found my love for the web and its technologies at the age of 14,
              when I build my first website. I teached myself a lot about HTML
              and CSS and loved to be able to craft something digital.

              During my university education and when getting into the basics of

              CSS, JavaScript and Front-end Development.

                  scientific publications. Therefore I analyzed all

                  extent they are used to disseminate the publications.

                  anounces them via Twitter and web notifications. The code for
