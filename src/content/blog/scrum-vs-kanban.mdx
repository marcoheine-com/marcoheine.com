I know what you’re thinking: Oh, come on! Not another blog post about Scrum vs.
Kanban. It’s 2023. Why are we still having this discussion?

The short answer is that **this debate will never be settled**. Because there is
no clear winner, and because of the selfish reason that I wanted to write a blog
post about my opinion and experience on this discussion.

A few days ago, I stumbled upon the article
[“You don’t need a scrum, you just need to do kanban right”](https://lucasfcosta.com/2022/10/02/scrum-versus-kanban.html)
by Lucas F. Costa, which inspired me to re-think and reflect on this and made me
want to express my feelings about it. I also looked into the hacker news
discussion around it, and it was really interesting to read everyone’s opinions
about this topic.

Developers love and hate both, and there seems to be no best framework. We must
constantly remind ourselves that **it’s just a framework** we can use to improve
our work processes. It’s not a guarantee for better work results. For a lot of
people, Scrum works great. It helped them improve their output as a team. The
same goes for Kanban. As I already said: there is no clear winner here.

### You just need to do Kanban right <a name="you-just-need-to-do-kanban-right"></a>

As I already said at the beginning, this blog post is inspired by reading “You
don’t need a scrum, you just need to do kanban right” by Lucas F. Coast. You
should go check out his whole blog post and read it yourself! I won’t cite all
the great points the author is making, but I’d like to highlight some of them.

Lucas F. Costa says teams can **respond to feedback quicker** when preferring
Kanban over Scrum because they don’t have to wait for the 2-week sprint cycle to
finish.

The **focus is shifted to the task instead of to the sprint-sized batch**.
Developers need to go after the information they need next which **increases
responsibility**, which leads to fewer back-and-forth discussions and fewer
decisions necessary, making them more responsive.

Lucas is also saying that **estimation meetings are wasted time** because they
should instead be used to code. I’m not sure I agree with that. Yes, estimation
is often a random gamble, but I think it still helps to get a feel for the task
and discuss the necessary steps.

What I like about his take on estimations is that instead of focusing on
estimations, focusing on getting the task in the system and out is preferable.

He also states that **making work visible** is no sole advantage of Scrum. The
Kanban board works very well for that.

### My personal experience with Scrum <a name="my-personal-experience-with-scrum"></a>

I’ve worked in many different teams where we used Scrum heavily. So I’ve had
quite some experience with it. Thus please bear in mind that this is my
**personal experience** and, therefore, nothing evidence-based or general
opinion. Nevertheless, here are some things that I noticed over and over again
when working with Scrum.

- Scrum always felt like we did it for everyone **outside** our team but not for
  ourselves. The time the meetings and organization around Scrum took felt
  insane to me. I often felt exhausted and unable to think straight after our
  sprint meetings.
- There usually were **developer deadlocks** where a person could not start to
  work on a new thing because we couldn’t pull it in the sprint. And because our
  planning didn’t allow it and wouldn’t be finished until our sprint ended with
  all the steps involved (review etc.).
- I noticed later that there was **no celebration** after a sprint ended. We
  just started immediately again the next day. Maybe there was a quick patting
  on the back, if any, but then we just jumped into the next planning meeting,
  and the worry about meeting the next sprint goal started again.
- Overall it felt **stressful** to me. We knew early on if the sprint goal was
  manageable or if we needed to ping our Product Owners to adjust the sprint
  goal. But this always felt like a loss.
- Retros felt good, but if you’d zoom out a bit, you’d noticed that we talked
  about the same points every month again, and **solutions were not
  implemented**.
- I often felt like I just wanted to put out the work, and all the planning and
  estimation was a **hurdle**. It wasn’t for me. It was for the stakeholders to
  sell our work and give others a deadline.

### Why I think Scrum can help <a name="why-i-think-scrum-can-help"></a>

I stated a lot of negative points above, but to be clear, I don’t dislike Scrum!
On the contrary, I think it has **excellent benefits** and can help a team
**flourish**.

I think Scrum can help teams who are **not well organized**. Where communication
is not done at its best and where it’s unclear how long specific work takes or
what people are working on. It can help these teams take a closer look at those
things and work on them.

I’ve worked in several different teams where Scrum significantly **boosted our
performance** and output. The main reason for that was that we had trouble
identifying bottlenecks. The communication was not the best, and sometimes we
waited too long to ask for help if we were stuck, and we had a hard time
estimating how long things took.

Scrum put the magnifying glass on these issues and helped to resolve them. It
literally made us more **agile**. We knew early on when trouble was ahead and
could find quick solutions by switching out things and communicating clearly to
our stakeholders. It felt like an ever-ongoing buzz, and so much was happening
and changing constantly.

### Why I prefer Kanban whenever I can <a name="why-i-prefer-kanban-whenever-i-can"></a>

The exact same reasons stated above, which make Scrum helpful, in my opinion,
contributed mainly to the fact that I prefer Kanban.

Whenever I was part of a team where we used Scrum, it was hard for me to get
into the **state of flow**, in a state of uninterrupted focus. Scrum felt to me
like something was going on all the time. I think that's the definition of
agile, but there have to be boundaries. And to me, the boundary of protecting
the developer's productivity was often **overstepped**.

I would say that I am a very good communicator. I let people know about my
status, if I'm stuck on something, if I need help, or if something takes longer
than expected. I've never had complaints from teammates that they don't know
about what I'm up to or that they had to wait for critical information from me.

By being a good communicator and handling things the way I explained above, I
gained a lot of **trust** from people. I appreciate that a lot. The final
conclusion for me here is: **I don't need a framework like Scrum to do my best
work**.

So it can feel hard and unnecessary to be put into a framework that doesn't
benefit me personally. Don’t get me wrong: often we don't have a choice, and I
don't have problems being part of a Scrum team in general. I can adapt and have
fun being part of a team that loves to work with Scrum.

As a freelancer I’m used to come into existing team who flourish by using Scrum
and I can easily **integrate** into that. But: If I have the choice and can pick
what works best for me, I always pick Kanban.

Kanban works way better for me. The planning part is rougher. When things are
done, I'm able to pick the next task, and so on. This suits my work style way
better. Because I can **focus on the output**, delivering the work, and
satisfying users and customers. I love to look at a Kanban board, see the
progress, make it visible, and be able to publish new features when they’re done
and not tied to a two-week cycle.

It gives me more **freedom** and also more **responsibility**. In the end, it
doesn’t matter what framework we use. We need to know how we work best, what we
need to achieve that, and follow the route it takes us. **Delivering great web
experiences where we help users accomplish their goals is what counts**.
