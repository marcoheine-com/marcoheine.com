Interview Questions. This is a GitHub repo which contains helpful lists of
frontend related questions to test yourself or extend your knowledge.

### <a name="doctype"></a> What does a DOCTYPE do?

The doctype makes sure the document gets parsed the same way by different
browsers. It prevents the browser from switching into
["quirks-mode"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Quirks_Mode_and_Standards_Mode)
when rendering a document.

### <a name="lng"></a>How do you serve a page with content in multiple languages?

By using the lang attribute on the html element `lang="en"`.

### <a name="multilingual"></a>What kind of things must you be wary of when design or developing for multilingual sites?

You have to enable an easy way for users to change their language. There is also
the possibility that people from different countries need different content.

### <a name="data-attributes"></a>What are data- attributes good for?

`data-` attributes ca be used to store extra information on standard, semantic
HTML elements without using non-standard attributes.

### <a name="html5"></a>Consider HTML5 as an open web platform. What are the building blocks of HTML5?

MDN lists several groups which form the building blocks of HTML5 and contain
many different technologies:

- **Semantics:** allowing you to describe more precisely what your content is
- **Connectivity:** allowing you to communicate with the server in new and
  innovative ways
- **Offline and storage:** allowing webpages to store data on the client-side
  locally and operate offline more efficiently
- **Multimedia:** making video and audio first-class citizens in the Open Web
- **2D/3D graphics and effects:** allowing much more diverse range of
  presentation options
- **Performance and Integration:** providing greater speed optimization and
  better usage of computer hardware
- **Device access:** allowing for the usage of various input and output devices
- **Styling:** letting authors write more sophisticated themes

### <a name="storage"></a>Describe the difference between a cookie, sessionStorage and localStorage.

When using a **Cookie**, data is sent to the server and is primarly for
server-side reading (but can also be read on the client side). The size must be
less than 4KB.

When using **sessionStorage**, the data is stored in the browser and can only be
read on the clientside. The stored data is only available for one session, so
when the browser tab gets closed, the data gets deleted. The storage limit is
larger than a Cookie (at least 5MB).

When using **localStorage**, the data gets also stored in the browser and can
only be read on the clientside. But it has no expiration date and the storage
limit is the maximum of the three.

### <a name="scripts"></a>Describe the difference between script, script async and script defer.

The regular `script` tag is used to embed or reference executable code and is
typically used to embed or refer to JavaScript code. When the browser comes
during the HTML parsing by a script tag it stops the rendering and executes the
JavaScript tag.

Using the script async tag will not block the rendering, but will run the script
as soon as it is downloaded and available.

The script defer tag will defer the script and run it after the page is done
parsing.

### <a name="link-and-script-positioning"></a> Why is it generally a good idea to position CSS links between head and JS scripts just before the body ends? Do you know any exceptions?

The CSS link has to be positioned in the head so it is downloaded and the
styling is available as fast as possible. If the css link is positioned inside
the body it is possible that the page is displayed without CSS for a short
periode of time. This is called FOUC (Flash of unstyled content).

It is also a good idea to put the JS script before the closing body tag. If you
put the JS script tag in the head or before the actual HTML content in the body,
the browser will stop the rendering and first download all the JS.

So it could be the case that the web page is only half visible for a short
periode of time because the rendering is blocked to download the JavaScript
first.

### <a name="srcset"></a> Why you would use a srcset attribute in an image tag? Explain the process the browser uses when evaluating the content of this attribute.

The `srcset` attribute is used to provide the same image in different versions,
depending on the viewport. So you can display the image with different width and
quality for mobile and different width and quality for desktop.

With the srcset attribute you will allow the browser to choose between, and what
size each image is. First you have to insert the file name, a space followed by
the image's inherent width in pixels.

The additional attribute sizes adds a set of media queries and tells the browser
what image size to choose when certain conditions are true. The sizes attribute
contains the media condition (max-width: 680px), a space, followed by the width
of the slot the image will fill when the media condition is true.
