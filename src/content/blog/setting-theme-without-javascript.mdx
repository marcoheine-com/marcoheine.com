Having the ability to set the color of a whole section is a pretty common
usecase in modern websites. If you're working with React there are two ways who
come across your mind, when you think about developing this feature.

### Using the most basic approach in React: props

Imagine you have a bunch of components who are styled based on the theme color.
We achieve that by using one of the most basic React features: props.

```jsx
...

// The component definition
const App = ({ themeColor }) => (
  <>
    <Header color={themeColor} />
    <Main color={themeColor} />
    <Footer color={themeColor} />
  </>
)

// Setting the theme color
<App themeColor='#9D3215' />
...
```

We just set the value of our themeColor on the root level, and this value is
passed down to every child component. Than it's used to style the components.

### Using React.Context

Another well known approach is to use React.Context. You first define your
context and wrapp your App component in a Context Provider.

```jsx
...

const ThemeContext = React.createContext('#9D3215')

const App = () => (
  <ThemeContext.Provider value='#9D3215'>
    <Header />
    <Main />
    <Footer />
  </ThemeContext.Provider>
)
```

Now every component is able to access this theme value by using the context
hook.

```jsx
...

const Header = () => {
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext)
  return <h1 style={{ color: theme }}>Logo</h1>
}

...
```

### Without any JavaScript

But wait! This is also possible without using any JavaScript. And with just
plain CSS. The basic idea is to wrap your App with a section tag for example and
set the color value on the section tag in specific css class.

Now every child component can check in their stylesheet, if the specific css
class is present, and if it is, it can use the color value. This is possible by
setting the color value to currentColor!

I created a working example on

And that's it! Setting the theme color for your whole app without any
JavaScript! I think that's a pretty cool alternative approach.
