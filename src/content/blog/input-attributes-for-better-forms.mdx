  Filling Forms on website can be an unnecessary pain. Recently I've learned
  about some simple steps to make Forms more user friendly.

Filling forms can be an **annoying and painful user experience**, especially if
you're on mobile. If you've ever tried to fill a long form on your phone and the
inputs weren't set up correctly, you know what I'm talking about.

The wrong keyboard opens, and you have to switch to special characters or
numbers all the time.

But this can be made so much easier and user-friendly with some simple steps.
Using the right input type value for the input is the first and, in most cases,
the only step you need to take.

For example, `<input type="email" />` will open up the right virtual keyboard on
mobile. The same goes for `type="url"`, `type="tel"` or `type="number"`.

But there are more attributes you can offer to make the user experience even
better.

Big thanks to Jeremy for teaching me about these attributes in this great
article
[Three attributes for better web forms](https://adactio.com/journal/19842?skin=default).

### inputmode

Inputmode is an attribute that can tell the browser to show a **specific virtual
keyboard**. This is redundant if you've already set the type to
`email, tel, url` or `search`.

But if you have an Input with the type text and you want to tell your users to
enter numbers there, `inputmode="numeric"` is super helpful. You can even
enclose the input by using `pattern="[0-9]*"`.

The other possible values for `inputmode` are
`text, numeric, decimal, search, email, tel` and `url`.

To learn more about it, check out the
[MDN documentation for inputmode](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/inputmode).

### enterkeyhint

As explained above, the inputmode provides help to show the correct virtual
keyboard, whereas the `enterkeyhint` attribute provides help to specify what is
shown on the enter key on a virtual keyboard.

The possible values are `enter, done, go, next, previous, search, send`. This is
helpful in tailoring the user experience to the specific input. For Contact
forms, it's usually `send`, and for search forms, it's `search`.

Checkout the full documentation for
[enterkeyhint on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/enterkeyhint).

### autocomplete

The autocomplete attribute is my favorite one. It doesn't specify the virtual
keyboard, like the previous attributes. Instead, it tells the browser that there
are values that could be used to pre-fill the Inputs.

This is such a great feature because it makes filling Forms a way more pleasant
experience.

There are several categories with different values you can use. For the `name`
category you can use
`given-name, additional-name, family-name, nickname, honorific-prefix, honorific-suffix`
and `username`. If you don't need to break it down into different parts, you can
use `name` itself.

The same goes for `tel` and `address`. Check out the available attributes on the
[MDN documentation of `autocomplete`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/autocomplete).

That's it; these are three awesome attributes you can use to make your forms
more user-friendly. I made a CodePen to showcase all the attributes explained in
this post. Check it out: <a href="https://codepen.io/Mkuehb/pen/wvEGPWK">Input Attributes for better Forms</a>.
