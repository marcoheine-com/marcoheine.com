title: Dividing frontend from backend is an antipattern

At a previous job I've worked on, there were clear lines between frontend
developers and backend developers. When being in a refinement meeting backend
developers would say things like "Oh I can't estimate this user story, it's
frontend!".

I always thought this made sense. At this time I never really worked in the
backend. It seemed "scary" to me, so I was absolutely fine with this
categorization.

[This article](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/dividing-frontend-backend-antipattern)
arguments clearly against this. Frontend became way more complex than a few
years ago and it's not only about making things look pretty anymore, the article
states. We already do the same work in the frontend and the backend.

If you think frontend and backend should be separated clearly, I definitely
recommend this article to you. Read it here:
