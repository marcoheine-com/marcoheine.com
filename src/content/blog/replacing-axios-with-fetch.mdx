[Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) is a npm package which makes
`http requests` easier. At the time axios came out, making http requests in the
browser was not really fun and axios made the life of a lot of developers
easier.

Since then a lot of things changed. A native
[fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) API is now
available. Kent C. Dodds wrote a blogpost why you might not need axios anymore
and can replace it easily with fetch.
