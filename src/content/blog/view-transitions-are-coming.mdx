You may have already heard that a new
[View Transitions API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transitions_API)
has been developed and will soon be available in all major browsers.

View Transitions help the user to stay in **context** when switching between
pages or states. For example, the user might click a link to another page, and
some elements might be animated to make the transition smoother and make it feel
less like a hard switch between the two pages.

It’s what makes most native apps **superior** in that case and looking so cool
and smooth. SwiftUI has had this kind of technology for years.

I have planned a whole blog post about the new View Transitions API as an
in-depth tutorial, but I will wait until every major browser supports them
(looking at you, Firefox), and we can use it in production.

Nevertheless, I’d like to discuss them briefly because
[Astro released a new major version (3.0)](https://astro.build/blog/astro-3)
last week. Part of this new release is enabling developers to use view
transitions inside Astro. That makes them the **first web framework to support
the View Transitions API**.

They offer these four different ways:

- **Morph** persistent elements from one page to another
- **Fade** content on and off the page for a less jarring navigation effect
- **Slide** content on and off the page for a bit more personality
- **Persist** common UI across pages, with or without a refresh

It’s straightforward to implement and use. You just have to import and add the
view transitions routing component on the page you want to use them.

```jsx
---
import { ViewTransitions } from 'astro/dist/components/view-transitions.js'
---

<h1>My Page</h1>
<ViewTransitions />
<div transition:name="fade">
  <p>Some content</p>
</div>
```

Astro will **automatically** create default page animations based on the
similarities between the old and the new pages. That’s all!

You can also identify the corresponding view transition element yourself. For
example, I wanted a view transition on the image in a blog post overview page
and on the image on the individual blog post.

So first, you view the list of blog posts, and when clicking on a specific blog
post, a view transition should happen on that image.

To achieve that, you only need to add the same `transition:name` value on both
image elements. It’s like magic!

If you want to see view transitions live in Astro, check out the
[Spotify clone built by Igor](https://github.com/igorm84/spotify-astro-transitions).
You have to make sure to use Chrome for that.

I’m curious how we’ll take advantage of this new possibility and if it will
change how it feels to browse the web.
