I really liked the [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) course by
[Wes Bos](https://twitter.com/wesbos), where you get to code 30 different
projects with plain JavaScript. Now he published another course which is also
available for free. This time it's all about learning
[CSS Grid](https://cssgrid.io/). In this blog post, I will document everything I
learned about CSS Grid in the course.

## <a name="setup"></a>General setup and basics of CSS Grid development

In the first few videos, Wes talks about the **tooling setup** for the course.
He uses [browsersync](https://browsersync.io/) for the local development which
is an npm package that automatically updates your browsers once you change the
HTML, CSS, images, or other project files.

It is such a great tool I couldn't work without, and that is why browsersync has
had its safe spot in my build tool setup with gulp for a long time.

Wes also talks about the basics of CSS Grid development with the **firefox
developer tools**. The basic principle reminds me of flexbox. You always have a
parent where you set `display: grid` and define the settings for columns, rows,
and the gap between them.

Child elements inside this parent can be positioned separately. The firefox dev
tools have a special layout window included where you can highlight the grid
View and also show the numbers of the grid cells, which is extremely helpful
when developing CSS Grid.

## <a name="implicit-vs-explicit"></a> Implicit vs. explicit Grid

The difference between explicit and implicit grid tracks is simple. When you
explicitly define grid columns with `grid-template-columns: 100px 100px` you get
**explicit** grid tracks.

If the browser notices that there is not enough space for all your items he
automatically creates a second row.

So these tracks are called **implicit** because the browser creates them and not
explicitly you.

The same applies if you have four items and define two rows. If you now add two
more items, the browser implicitly creates a new row. With `grid-auto-rows` and
`grid-auto-columns`, you can style any implicitely created row or column.

<CodePen

  title="CSS Grid - Implicit vs. Explicit Tracks"
/>

## <a name="grid-auto-flow"></a> Grid-auto-flow

If you have two items, define two columns using
`grid-template-columns: 200px 400px` and then add a third item, the browser will
put this item automatically in a new row below like, described before, with
implicit tracks.

This means `grid-auto-flow` is set to row by default. If you set `grid-auto-row`
to `column`, the third item will be automatically put into a new column next to
the other items.

<CodePen
  id="wyNjJK"
  title="CSS Grid - grid-auto-flow"
/>

## <a name="sizing-tracks"></a> Sizing tracks

The `fr` unit represents the amount of space left after all elements are laid
out.

If you define three columns with `grid-template-columns: 200px 200px 1fr`, the
first two columns will be 200px wide, and the last one will take up all the
space that is left.

`fr` stands for **fractional unit**, but Wes likes to call it free space which
helps with remembering the idea of the fr unit.

It is also possible to use the auto keyword. Then an item will be sized
according to the content it contains.

<CodePen
  id="ddaKbb"
  title="CSS Grid - sizing tracks"
/>

## <a name="repeat-function"></a> Repeat function

Instead of writing:

```css
grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr 1fr;
```

you can simply use the CSS Grid repeat function and write:

```css
grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
```

<CodePen
  id="vdbVeX"
  title="CSS Grid - repeat function"
/>

## <a name="sizing-grid-items"></a> Sizing Grid Items

By default, grid items just flow one after another, and as there is space for
each one, they will fit themselves into the grid as they can.

There is also a way to more precisely size grid items inside a parent grid
container. The instruction `grid-column: span 2` tells the browser to size the
specific child element with the space and width of two columns. The same goes
for `grid-row: span 2`.

<CodePen
  id="zWOYge"
  title="CSS Grid - sizing grid items"
/>

## <a name="placing-grid-items"></a> Placing Grid Items

There are also better ways to position grid items than just sizing them. With
`grid-column-start` and `grid-column-end` you can define where a grid item
should start and where it should end. There is also a shortcut property for this
so with `grid-column: 2 / 5`, the grid item starts with the second column and
ends before the fifth.

You can also define that the grid item should start at the first column and span
over two columns with `grid-column: 1 / span 2`.

If you want your grid item to start at the first column and span over the last,
but you don't know how many columns you have, just use `grid-column: 1 / -1`.

<CodePen
  id="BrByaZ"
  title="CSS Grid - Placing Grid Items"
/>

The second CodePen example below shows all the different ways to place grid
items inside a grid container. Have a look into the CSS to check how it is done.

<CodePen
  id="oqvjOv"
  title="CSS Grid - Spanning and Placing Cardio"
/>

## <a name="auto-fit-auto-fill"></a> auto-fit and auto-fill

With the `auto-fill` expression inside the `grid-template-columns` declaration
you can tell the browser, "hmm, I'm not sure how many columns I want, make each
150px wide, for example, and then fill it with as many columns as possible".

So `grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, 150px);` does that.

The difference between `auto-fill` and `auto-fit` is visible when you have not
enough items to fill the grid.

With `auto-fill` the grid will create as many columns as possible, although you
don't have enough items. So if you have four items and there is space for six,
the explicit grid ends after six items. In comparison to that, `auto-fit` ends
the grid when all available items are placed inside your grid.

In the CodePen example below, open the firefox dev tools, enable the grid view
in the layout window, and you will see the difference between `auto-fit` and
`auto-fill`.

<CodePen
  id="BrayPm"
  title="CSS Grid - auto-fill & auto-fit"
/>

## <a name="minmax"></a> Using minmax for responsive grids

With `minmax()`, you can tell the browser to make the items in a column a
minimum width of `150px` and a maximum width of `1fr`, for example. So the items
will automatically adapt to the available space.

This is also a great way to create a responsive grid without media queries.

When the grid items already have the minimum width declared with `minmax()` and
the browser window gets smaller; they will automatically jump into the next row.

The CodePen example below also shows the difference between `auto-fit` and
`auto-fill` in combination with `minmax()`.

<CodePen
  id="jzOPzg"
  title="CSS Grid - Using minmax() for Responsive Layouts"
/>

## <a name="template-areas"></a> Grid template areas

Grid Template areas come in handy for building a whole layout of a page. Say you
want to have two sidebars left and right and a content place between them. Below
you want to have the footer spanning over the whole row.

With grid template areas, you can type your grid parent into the
`grid-template-areas` instruction exactly how you want the layout to look.

On the grid items, meaning the child items of the parent, you then tell each
item with `grid-area` which part of the layout it should be. That's it! Simple
and easy full-page layout.

The firefox dev tools also offer the possibility to display your grid area names
so you can quickly check if your layout is displayed as you wish it to be.

<CodePen
  id="GxRjdW"
  title="CSS Grid - Grid Template Areas"
/>

## <a name="naming-lines"></a> Naming lines in CSS Grid

By default, you declare to span your grid items over the columns and rows by
using the line names 1,2,3, and so on. CSS Grid also offers the possibility to
rename your line names on the `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows`
declaration on the parent.

So if your initial declaration for the columns and the rows on the grid
container is like this:

```css
grid-template-columns: 1fr 500px 1fr;
grid-template-rows: repeat(10, auto);
```

and you want to span an item inside the middle column from the top to the tenth
line you would say:

```css
grid-column: 2;
grid-row: 2/10;
```

By renaming your columns and rows, you can now position your item inside this
grid using the new line names.

```css
grid-template-columns: [site-left] 1fr [content-start] 500px [content-end] 1fr [site-right];
grid-template-rows: [content-top] repeat(10, auto) [content-bottom];
```

<CodePen
  id="mxdQQN"
  title="CSS Grid - Naming Lines in CSS Grid"
/>

## <a name="block-fitting"></a> Grid-auto-flow dense block fitting

Grid-auto-flow is, by default, set to row, so every item that does not fit in
the same row will automatically be put into a new row below. This can be helpful
but also not really useful in a lot of cases.

If you have a grid with ten columns and you want every sixth item to span over
six columns, there will be a lot of empty space because the six-column-long item
often can't fit in the same row and is put into the next row via
`grid-auto-flow: row` and the space left over is not filled with other items.

In this case, the dense value comes to help.
[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-auto-flow) describes
this value as follows:

> "Dense is a keyword specifying that the auto-placement algorithm uses a
> 'dense' packing algorithm, which attempts to fill in holes earlier in the
> grid, if smaller items come up later. This may cause items to appear
> out-of-order, when doing so would fill in holes left by larger items".

Go ahead and turn the `grid-auto-flow: dense` instruction on and off in the
CodePen example below to see the difference.

<CodePen
  id="wmMKxY"
  title="CSS Grid - grid-auto-flow block formatting"
/>

## <a name="alignment-and-centering"></a> CSS Grid alignment + centering

Flexbox made centering items on a page really easy. CSS Grid also has its ways
to center items without problems.

There are two main properties that can be used for that. `justify-_` defines
everything on the row axis, and `align-_` defines everything on the column axis.

With `justify-items` and `align-items`, you can define the alignment for your
grid items on the grid container. There is also a shorthand called `place-items`
which you can give two values, the first for the justify-_ property and the
second for the align-_ property.

If your grid items don't fill up your whole grid, you can use `justify-content`
and `align-content` to align them as one inside your grid container.

Finally, with `justify-self` and `align-self`, you can overwrite the alignment
settings on the container and specify them on a single grid item.

<CodePen
  id="GxoqOy"
  title="CSS Grid - Alignment and Centering"
/>

## <a name="re-ordering"></a> Re-ordering Grid items

Imagine having a ten-column wide grid with a logo on the left that spans over
two columns, a nav on the right that spans over eight columns, and a full-width
content below.

It is possible to change the order of the logo and the nav easily so that the
logo will be on the right and the nav on the left.

By default, every item has a value of 0 on the order property. So giving the nav
`order: 0`, the logo `order: 1`, and the content `order: 3` will achieve the
re-ordering.

It is important to mention that this technique will goof up the order a screen
reader will read it, so it is kind of bad practice concerning accessibility if
you use this on a bunch of paragraphs, for example. But for a nav and a logo, it
does not matter that much.

## Real World Examples <a name="real-world-examples"></a>

### <a name="album-layouts"></a> Nesting Grid with album layouts

In this example, you can see several album info boxes consisting of an image and
a few details about the album. To achieve this layout, you have to define the
columns on the main grid first, which contains every album info box.

With the following expression, you can define a grid that has columns with a
minimum width of `400px` and a maximum width of `1fr`.

```css
grid-template-columns: repeat(minmax(400px, 1fr));
```

So depending on the available space, the Grid will add columns or remove columns
and shrink or expand them accordingly, which creates a fully flexible and
responsive layout without media queries.

To achieve the layout inside the album info boxes, it is important to know that
grid items can also be grid containers, as we know from flexbox already.

So you can add two columns into every album info box so the album image has a
width of `150px` and the text takes all the remaining space. Vertical alignment
is also possible.

```css
display: grid;
align-items: center;
grid-template-columns: 150px 1fr;
```

<CodePen
  id="jzqXVo"
  title="CSS Grid - Nesting grid with album layouts"
/>

### <a name="css-grid-image-gallery"></a> CSS Grid image gallery

The next example is about building an image gallery with CSS Grid. The basic
grid for this consists of repeating columns and rows that are 100px wide and
high. This example is extended with a little bit of JavaScript to give each
image a different width and height.

Therefore you have to make an array with a length of 50. `Array.from` is pretty
useful in this case. Every Item of this array is an array itself consisting of
two random numbers between 1 and 4. These two values will describe the
horizontal and vertical length of the image.

For every item of the digits array, you then have to build the HTML, which
consists of the image, an overlay, and a close button. By using ES6
destructuring, you can insert the randomly generated numbers for the horizontal
and vertical values and use them as CSS class names.

By doing that, you will get 50 different images in the grid with a random row
and column-span between 1 and 4. Using the dense value on the `grid-auto-flow`
property, you can avoid having too many empty spots in between.

Another useful thing I learned here is that by setting two grid items in the
same row and column, they will overlap. Very practical for adding overlay
elements.

### <a name="flexbox-vs-grid"></a> Flexbox vs. CSS Grid

In general, CSS Grid can do everything Flexbox can do. Some people say that
Flexbox is for laying out elements in one dimension, and CSS Grid is for laying
out elements in two dimensions.

In this example, Wes shows how things solved previously with flexbox can be done
with CSS Grid and in what scenarios Flexbox is still the winner. You can find
all the examples in the CodePen below.

<CodePen
  id="wmoVjp"
  title="CSS Grid - Flexbox vs. CSS Grid"
/>

### <a name="recreating-codepen"></a> Recreating CodePen

In this example, you are recreating CodePen, the tool I have used to display all
the examples before. CodePen is a development environment that allows you to
write code in the browser and see the results immediately.

This example is good practice for learning to layout different sections of a
page with CSS Grid. Basically, it is all about grids inside other grids.

<CodePen
  id="MVmwpZ"
  title="CSS Grid - Recreating CodePen"
/>

### <a name="bootstrappy-grid"></a> Bootstrappy Grid with CSS variables

Bootstrap became very popular for implementing an easy way to use a responsive
grid on a website. It implemented CSS classes for the orientation of your
elements, how they should behave on different viewports, and how far they would
span in your grid.

So a div with the class of `col-sm-4` would span over four columns on a viewport
equal to or greater than 768px wide.

In this example Wes shows how to achieve the Bootstrap principle with CSS Grid.

<CodePen
  id="RMVPdj"
  title="CSS Grid - Bootstrappy Grid with CSS Variables"
/>

### <a name="responsive-website"></a> Responsive Website

In this example, Wes shows how to build a **whole responsive** website with
**CSS Grid**. He divides the page into several sections and then uses almost
every technique of CSS Grid learned in the course to lay out the page.

Another thing Wes teaches here, and I liked, is the usage of aria attributes on
buttons. So Instead of adding and removing a CSS class on the button, you can
simply check the aria attributes value of the button and also use the aria
attributes value for styling.

In this example, the button to open the navigation menu has the aria attribute
`aria-expanded="false"` which indicates by default that the menu is not
expanded.

Additionally, it has the aria attribute `aria-controls="menu-list"` which
indicates that the button controls the element with the class of menu-list which
is, in this case, the navigation.

By changing the values of these attributes with JavaScript, you can toggle the
menu easily.

### <a name="blog-layout"></a> Full bleed blog layout

The last example is about building a blog layout with sections of different
width and elements.
