I'm a bit annoyed by YouTube Shorts on my YouTube feed page. I'm there for for
long-term format videos and Shorts just are not my kind of thing.

Rach Smith recently shared this great post on
<a href="https://rachsmith.com/remove-youtube-shorts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how
to remove shorts from your YouTube Subscription feed with `:has()` &#8599;</a>
and I was so happy when I stumbled over this post.

She uses it to set `display: none` on every on every item in the feed with child
elements that are shorts.

Here are the selectors she wrote, both for the grid and the list view:

```css
/* Grid View */
#items.ytd-grid-renderer
  > ytd-grid-video-renderer:has(
    ytd-thumbnail-overlay-time-status-renderer[overlay-style='SHORTS']
  ) {
  display: none;
}

/* List View */
ytd-item-section-renderer:not(:has(ytd-grid-renderer)):has(
    ytd-thumbnail-overlay-time-status-renderer[overlay-style='SHORTS']
  ) {
  display: none;
}
```

You'd need to add that to a browser extension to apply these custom styles and
then you're good to go. Bye bye Shorts!
