If you wanted to integrate a popover on a website before, you had to reach out
to a **third-party package** in the past because they made it easy to customize
things like positioning and enhancing functionality. This may soon be a tale of
the past!

[The popover API](https://hidde.blog/popover-semantics/) with the popover
attribute was introduced recently and is available in Chromium 114. By using
this new popover API, it will be **easier to integrate popovers into websites**.
It brings all the needed functionality and satisfies all the **accessibility
concerns**. And all of that without using any JavaScript.

To make use of the new popover API, three basic things are required:

- the popover attribute on the element containing the popover
- an id on the element containing the popover
- the element which opens the popover needs to have a popovertarget attribute
  with the value of the popover’s id

```html
<button popovertarget="popover">Open popover</button>

<div
  popover
  id="popover"
>
  <p>Popover content</p>
</div>
```

Implementing such a popover is **accessible by default** because the popover and
its trigger are **connected semantically**. Furthermore, closing the popover
with the ESC key is built-in, making it easy for keyboard users to dismiss it.

In addition to that, the new popover has a **light-dismiss functionality**. If
you click anywhere outside the popover, it will close and return focus. If you
open the popover, the next keyboard tab will stop inside the popover, so **focus
management is handled by default**.

Another great advantage of it is that the popover will always appear on a
separate level above the rest of the page, so there is **no need for manual
z-index handling**.

That’s such a great addition, I can’t wait until it’s stable in all modern
browsers and we can use it! It’s a big step into easier and faster ways to build
websites and improve accessibility by default.

It’s important to note that the new popover attribute **will only add behavior,
not semantics**. Popovers have no default role, and you’re supposed to add your
own semantics to it! Hidde de Vries wrote an
[excellent post about different semantics](https://hidde.blog/popover-semantics/)
that could make sense for popover-behaved elements. He takes a closer look at
menus, dialogs, and listboxes.
