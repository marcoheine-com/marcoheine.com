Welcome to 2023!

It seems a bit late to write this at the start of February, but as this is the
first post of the developer diaries series in 2023, I think it’s still good to
say!

## 👨🏻‍💻 Work

Time goes by fast, and January 2023 is already over. Unfortunately, the year
started slow for me. We had two big projects planned for mid of January, and
both got pushed into later this year.

But that wasn’t a problem; it allowed me to **shift my focus** to other things.
This meant I increased my workload in my maintenance jobs and took a lot more
time to write!

I also tried to plan my year a bit. One thing I’ve learned already after almost
a year of freelancing is that you get a lot of **flexibility** in how you can
work, but you also have to be very flexible. Projects can be canceled,
postponed, or need to start immediately. Everything can happen, and that is what
makes it so fun for me.

When I talked to other freelancers, who are a bit longer in the game, they all
agreed that January is a quiet month concerning freelancing.

People are still on holiday, and it takes time until everyone returns at Work.
Companies are still in the planning phase of the year. Budgets still need to be
approved.

So I was grateful for this relaxed month and took the opportunity. I have a lot
of exciting projects planned for this year, and I can’t wait to get into them!

## 📝 Blog Posts of the month

As I already said, fewer client projects meant more time for focused writing. So

## 🏡 Life

Hello, new category! I also want to write about general things in my life, what
happened, how I’m feeling, and what I’ve learned, so let’s see what this
category will contain.

We moved in January! Moving is always stressful; it takes so much time and
energy. But it was totally worth it. We moved out of the city, as we are not
using most of the advantages a city offers, like going to bars and clubs.

We moved closer to family and nature and got a bigger flat. All in all, it’s a
fantastic life upgrade. We already enjoy the quieter surroundings a lot.

## 🏋🏻‍♀️ Fitness

Due to the whole process of moving, this was, at least for the first few weeks,
the only workout I got. But I’m slowly getting into a great workout routine. The
current plan is:

- yoga on Monday and Friday,
- a strength workout on Tuesday and Thursday,
- a Zone 2 workout (Zwift ride) on Wednesday.

So let’s see how this turns out!

Here are my Apple Watch rings from January:

## 📚 Reading

I finally finished one of the biggest books I’ve ever read.

- [Fall of Giants - Ken Follett](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7315573-fall-of-giants)

I think it’s fantastic, and I definitely will read the other two books of the
series. I’ll take some time first to read some smaller books 😅

## 🕹Video Games

No playing any video games in January!

## 🎙Podcasts

I’m back in the podcast game! I noticed how much a like
the [Syntax.fm](http://syntax.fm/) Podcast by Wes and Steve and I listened to
three episodes this month. I think this will be a habit again soon.

- [Syntax.fm  Container Queries explained ](https://syntax.fm/show/566/container-queries-explained)
- [Syntax.fm Supper Club × Simen Svale Skogsrud and Espen Hovlandsdal from Sanity ](https://syntax.fm/show/565/supper-club-simen-svale-skogsrud-and-espen-hovlandsdal-from-sanity)
- [Syntax.fm Serverless Databases](https://syntax.fm/show/551/serverless-databases)

That’s it for the Developer Diaries in January! See you next month!
