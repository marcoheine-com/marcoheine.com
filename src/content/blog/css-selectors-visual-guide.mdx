CSS has become way more **powerful** over the last few years. A lot of
significant improvements were added to the language, and I like the way where it
is going.

Recently, I stumbled over this
[CSS Selectors Visual Guide by Sébastien Noël](https://fffuel.co/css-selectors),
and I love it. I would have loved this when I started learning and working with
CSS!

As the name suggests, it is a **visual guide to all the CSS selectors**. You get
an example of the selector on the left and an image of the selected element on
the right. I'm surprised no one else has done this before.

This is a definite bookmark for me. Although I've been working with CSS for
years, I even **learned something new**. I learned about the
[lobotomized owl selector](https://fffuel.co/css-selectors/#lobotomized), which
selects all elements with a preceding sibling.

```css
* + * {
  margin-top: 1.5em;
}
```

It's a great way to select all elements, but not the first one in a container. I
can imagine that I will visit this guide a lot in the future because of the
great overview it provides. If you forgot about the exact selector for valid
inputs or attribute selectors just head over there.
