November was a great month, I liked it a lot. It was about remembering my
[values](/about/#values), being able to choose with whom I work and great
teamwork.

## 👨🏻‍💻 Work

This month I once again noticed that it's incredible that I can work with people
who share the same **work** **habits** and **principles** as me. They deny a lot
that doesn't fit into these values we have in common.

I can say no to work that contradicts my work ethic, which is a huge privilege,
and I'm more than **grateful** for that.

In November, I was on the edge of finalizing a great project with my friend
Tobi. It will be released in December, and I'm pleased about the outcome.
Working together with Tobi is the most fun and motivational. We have a great
workflow and are both experts in our field, which is a powerful combination.

We already have fantastic projects planned for the next year, and I can't wait
to get started on them. If you also want to start a project and need two great
guys who're able to help you with that,
[check out the website of our collective](https://www.werk8.design/).

Besides that, I worked on the aerosol alliance website for the first time since
the summer. We did a silent go-live a few months ago and are slowly sending
people to it. It's a great project for a great cause, and I'm thrilled I can
help these guys.

## 📝 Blog Posts of the month

I dedicated less time to writing this month. On the one hand, I missed it, and
on the other hand, it felt good to use this time for other stuff. I'm not sure
how to deal with it next month. We'll see. Here are the blog posts for November
2022:

- [What's new in Next.js 13](/blog/whats-new-in-nextjs-13/)
- [Web Developer Diary #6](/blog/web-developer-diary-06/)

## 🎓 TIL Posts of the month

Here are the Today-I-learned posts for November 2022:

- [Tech pays in Europe](/today-i-learned/tech-pays-in-europe/)
- [Never use px for font-size](/today-i-learned/never-use-px-for-font-size/)

## 🏋🏻‍♀️ Fitness

I can't believe I'm saying this, but: I started running again! I quit it over
ten years ago because my knees always hurt. I'm willing to give it another
chance now. I started slow to protect my knees, but it felt amazing running on
the beach in the Netherlands.

Besides that, I'm doing a mix of yoga and bodyweight fitness almost every
morning, which feels like the perfect combination.

Here are my apple watch rings from November 2022:

## 📚 Reading

I only finished one book this month; I wasn't so motivated to read. I'm not sure
if the book I read was the reason or that I was often too tired to read.

The book I finished was something special. It includes highly controversial and
horrible topics and is not your usual read. Nevertheless, it has an interesting
story. I'm not sure what to make of it yet.

## 🕹Video Games

In November, the new Pokemon games for the Nintendo Switch were released, which
I anticipated very much. So we bought both editions, Violet and Scarlet, so my
wife and I could play simultaneously.

I'm not sure if I like it so far; it has a lot of bugs and looks not too good.
But in the end, it's Pokemon, which I love.

## 🎙Podcasts

I did listen to podcasts, but nothing tech related. I don't know what to do with
this category; my motivation to listen to developer podcasts is insignificant.

## 🔔 A special note

You may have noticed the name change! I was never too sure about the title "web
developer diary." However, I like the new one more and want to try it out. Let's
see where this lead.

That's it for November 2022. See you next month!
