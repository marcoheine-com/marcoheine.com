  Today I learned that there is an automatic ER diagram generator for prisma

Someone on Twitter shared this
[automatic ER diagram generator](https://github.com/keonik/prisma-erd-generator)
for prisma.

At my last job we manually updated our ER diagram on every change. And now I
learn that something like this exists? Mindblown 🤯

Would have loved to have this. You can imagine how much work is involved in
updating something so crucial to your business like this manually. And all the
times you forget it or update the wrong entities. This plugin is a lifesaver!
