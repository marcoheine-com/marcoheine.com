Someone once told me: a great way to learn to code is to look at other peoples code. A great way for doing that is, of course, GitHub. But GitHub is huge and has so much repositories, where can you start?

Enter Grep App. This website makes it possible to search all GitHub repositories for specific code snippets. So for example if you wanted to learn more about the useEffect hook and how other people are using it, just search for useEffect on grep.app.
