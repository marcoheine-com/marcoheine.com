When I started learning NodeJS and researched a lot on this topic, I stumbled
across this video from

[![What the heck is the event loop anyway?](https://img.youtube.com/vi/8aGhZQkoFbQ/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ)

I already watched it years ago but did not remember everything. Especially in
the context of learning NodeJS but also when you're learning JavaScript in
general this is one of the best videos teaching a topic about the language ever.

I rewatched it and learned a ton about the **JS event loop** and **asynchronous
programming**. So good!
