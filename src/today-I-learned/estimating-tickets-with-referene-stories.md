Do you find yourself having a hard time estimating user stories right in your refinement meetings?

Does it feel more like a lucky guess if this feature should be a 5 or an 8?

A great way to overcome this uncertainty is to keep track of all your refined and estimated stories and group them by estimation.

So if your wondering in your next refinement meeting if this feature is really a 13, just check your table of reference stories and see what other stories got estimated with a 13.

If you think the amount of work this requires comes close to the stories in there, you can gain more confidence with your estimations.
