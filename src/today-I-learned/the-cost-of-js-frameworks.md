Tim Kadlec did an in depth analysis of the most common JavaScript frameworks right now and their performance.

It&apos;s totally worth the read because he analyzed a lot of data, got some interesting insights and conclusions. His final claim is:

> What is clear: right now, if you’re using a framework to build your site, you’re making a trade-off in terms of initial performance—even in the best of scenarios.

But the article is of course not about blindly bashing the current JavaScript framework spectrum. It is more about analyzing current problemes and showing ways to solve them. Very important and well researched article.
