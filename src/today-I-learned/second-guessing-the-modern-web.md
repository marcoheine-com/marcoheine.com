Today I learned about an article from Tom MacWright, which is, in my opinion,
one of the most important and controversial articles about web development
in 2020.

I don&apos;t want to write to much about it here, just take 10 minutes of your
time, head over there and read it. It's absolutely worth it and will make you
think.

It's title is _Second-guessing the modern web_ and Tom writes about how the idea
of building a React single-page application with server rendering has swept the
internet and how he's increasingly skeptical of it.
