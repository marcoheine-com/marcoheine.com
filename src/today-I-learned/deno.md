Today I learned about Deno. Deno - what is that? Another React competitor, another JS framework which will "make everything better and easer"?

No, not really. It aims to replace Node.js. Wait a minute. What?

Yep, you've heard right. Deno is a new runtime for executing JavaScript and TypeScript outside of the web browser. It claims that Node.js has a lot of design mistakes and was built at a time where JavaScript was a different language. Therefore it is not fun anymore to build something with Node.js today.

Deno aims to simplify working with JS and TS outside of the browser and makes working with it fun again.

My knowledge of Node.js is by far to small to be able to classify that but it sounds interesting and I will keep an eye on it.
