### Props in React <a id="props-in-react"></a>

To understand the concept of Prop drilling, we first need to clarify **what
props are** in React and how they are such a crucial aspect of
Reacts **success** concerning unidirectional data flow.

If you're already familiar with the concept of props in React,
[skip to the next section](#what-is-prop-drilling) in this article. But you also
might learn something new, like I did, although you've been working with React
for a while.

First and foremost, props are short for **Properties**. Props are used
to **communicate** from one component to another. For example, a Parent
Component can **pass information to children** by using the concept of props. To
pass props, you have to add them to the JSX, just like you can do with HTML
attributes.

You can pass some **predefined props** to your child components, like
`className`. You can also pass any props you want to your children. To read the
props, you can either destructure the individual props inside your functions
parenthesis or access the whole props object. Props are almost like function
parameters.

Here is a simple example of passing props down from a parent to a child
component and reading it there:

```JSX
// Parent Component

function ProductDetails() {
  return (
    <ProductHeader
      className="parent-component"
      productName="The best product ever"
    />
  );
}

// Child Component accessing the whole props object
function ProductHeader(props) {
  return (
    <div className={props.className}>
      <h1>{props.productName}</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

// Child Component destructuring the props object
function ProductHeader({ className, productName }) {
  return (
    <div className={className}>
      <h1>{productName}</h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Not only can you pass values via props down to your children, but you can also
send whole components through that informational pipeline. The parent component
can access the nested component via the **children's prop** by nesting a
component inside another component.

That's called **passing JSX as children** and is a widespread concept when
composing React apps. This gets important again when we talk about how to avoid
prop drilling. Here's an example of it:

```jsx
function ProductDetails() {
  return (
    <ProductHeader>
      <div>
        <h1>The best product ever</h1>
      </div>
    </ProductHeader>
  )
}

function ProductHeader({ children }) {
  return <div>{children}</div>
}
```

### What is prop drilling? <a id="what-is-prop-drilling"></a>

Now that we understand props in React, let's talk about prop drilling and why it
can become a problem.

We talk about prop drilling when we **pass the same props several levels deep
down the component tree**. Often these props get passed through components that
**are not interested** in them but need to help pass them down to a certain
point where they are required.

Here's an example of that. Imagine you have a component tree like this:

```jsx
<App>
  <Header />
  <MainContent>
    <ProductList>
      <ProductCard>
        <ProductDetailsModal>
          <ProductDetails>
            <ProductHeader />
            <ProductDescription />
            <ProductPrice />
          </ProductDetails>
        </ProductDetailsModal>
      </ProductCard>
    </ProductList>
  </MainContent>
  <Footer />
</App>
```

On the root level, you fetch the data of the products from your API and pass it
down to the components that need it.

Imagine we want to display the name of product in the `ProductHeader` component.
This means we need to pass the prop that withholds this information **all the
way** through our component tree six levels down. On the way five components get
this information, altough they **aren't even interested in it**.

```jsx
const productName = 'The best product ever'

<App productName={productName}>
  <Header />
  <MainContent productName={productName}>
    <ProductList productName={productName}>
      <ProductCard productName={productName}>
        <ProductDetailsModal productName={productName}>
          <ProductDetails productName={productName}>
            <ProductHeader productName={productName} />
            <ProductDescription />
            <ProductPrice />
          </ProductDetails>
        </ProductDetailsModal>
      </ProductCard>
    </ProductList>
  </MainContent>
  <Footer />
</App>
```

Why is this a problem? This seems to be the recommended way to pass down
information in React. For a few levels deep, making use of prop drilling is
fine.

But it gets **messy** if you apply this technique several levels down the
component tree. First of all, passing props down so deeply involves **a lot of
work**. And second, if you make one change to these props, you have to update
these changes everywhere, which makes it **verbose and inconvenient**.

Another big reason to avoid prop drilling is that **debugging is harder**.
Imagine you notice that on the level where you do something with the data, you
pass down so many levels, you get wrong values. So now you must trace the data
through all the components and figure out where something went wrong.

### Context is not the solution <a id="context-is-not-the-solution"></a>

When React Context was introduced, many developers believed this was the perfect
solution for a) **global state management** in React and b) **to avoid prop
drilling**.

Context lets a parent component **provide data to the entire tree below**.
Here's an example of using context with the code from above:

```jsx
const ProductContext = React.createContext()

function App() {
  const productName = 'The best product ever'

  return (
    <ProductContext.Provider value={productName}>
      <Header />
      <MainContent />
      <Footer />
    </ProductContext.Provider>
  )
}

function ProductHeader() {
  const productName = React.useContext(ProductContext)

  return <h1>{productName}</h1>
}
```

First we have to create a context object with `React.createContext()`. Then we
wrap our whole Application with a `Provider` component that provides the data we
want to pass down to the entire tree below.

At the point where we want to access the data, we use the `useContext` Hook to
access the data. In this case it's `ProductHeader`, which, as we've seen in the
example above, lies deeply nested inside the `MainContent` component.

This looks perfect, right? No need to pass props down several levels deep and we
can access it easily, where we actually need it.

If you consider using context to avoid prop drilling, I must disappoint you.
That's a bad idea. **Just because you must pass some props several levels deep
doesn't mean you should put that information into context**.

It's really easy to overuse this concept. So the official recommendation by the
React docs is to use context only for specific use cases and not just to avoid
prop drilling.

One of these use cases is theming, for example. If you want to style your
components differently, context is helpful to provide this information to the
components that need it when a dark mode is applied, for example. You can check
out the other recom use-cases for Context in the
[official React docs](https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context#before-you-use-context).

### Composition <a id="composition"></a>

So, what else can we do if context is not the perfect solution to avoid prop
dilling? The answer is **composition**. Composition in React means how you
arrange your component tree. Dan Abramov, one of the core team members for
React, even wrote a tweet that
[being good at composing your React components is a top skill to learn in 2023 ](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/1623771055943831553).

Let's recap real quick. First, prop drilling in React can be verbose and
inconvenient because debugging a prop passed down through many components can be
hard to debug.

And If you pass some data through many layers of intermediate components that
don't use that data (and only pass it further down), this often means that you
forgot to extract some components along the way.

Extracting some components along the way is kind of a definition for composition
in React. So you have to ask yourself: does it make sense that this component is
nested down several levels deep and passes data along it's not interested in? Or
can it be on a higher level up the component tree or part of another component
so we can remove a whole level on the component tree?

That's always the first step you have to make, when you notice that you have to
pass props down several levels deep.

Remember when we talked about passing JSX as children? This comes in handy when
you thinkg about composition in React and want to avoid prop drilling. Here's
our prop drilling example from above with a better composition:

```jsx
const productName = 'The best product ever'

<App>
  <Header />
  <MainContent>
    <ProductList productName={productName}>
      <ProductCard>
        <ProductDetailsModal>
          <ProductDetails>
            <ProductHeader />
            <ProductDescription />
            <ProductPrice />
          </ProductDetails>
        </ProductDetailsModal>
      </ProductCard>
    </ProductList>
  </MainContent>
  <Footer />
</App>

function ProductList ({ productName }) {
  return (
    <ProductCard>
      <ProductDetailsModal>
        <ProductDetails>
          <ProductHeader>
            <h1>{productName}</h1>
          </ProductHeader>
          <ProductDescription />
          <ProductPrice />
        </ProductDetails>
      </ProductDetailsModal>
    </ProductCard>
  )
}
```

In this example, composition in React is used to avoid prop drilling by passing
down the necessary props to child components **without having to pass them down
explicitly at each level**. The example demonstrates how to pass the
`productName` prop from the top-level App component down to the ProductHeader
component, which is nested several levels deep in the component hierarchy.

To achieve this, the ProductList component accepts the productName prop and
renders the ProductCard component with the necessary props. The ProductCard
component then renders the ProductDetailsModal component with the necessary
props, and so on until the ProductHeader component is rendered.

They main idea here is, that **we have to pass the prop only into one
component**, `ProductList`. This enables us to give the `ProductHeader` the
`productName` prop way higher up the component tree. This way we can avoid
passing the prop down several levels deep and prop drilling is no longer an
issue.

In conclusion, composition in React is a powerful technique that can help to
avoid prop drilling, which is a common issue when passing props down several
levels in the component tree.

By passing JSX as props we can avoid prop drilling which leads to cleaner and
more maintainable code. By using composition, we can create more modular and
reusable components, which can be easier to reason about and maintain over time.
Overall, composition is a key concept in React development that can lead to more
efficient and effective development practices.
