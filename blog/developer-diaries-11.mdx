  'Developer Diaries 11 is about a lot of thoughts about AI, having a
  diversified work month and the joy of weekend getaways.'
---

Last month was pretty busy with **new AI changes almost every hour**. Everyone
is either **scared** of what might happen, if we lose our jobs, or if humanity
might get destroyed or enjoying the ride, being **excited** about the stuff that
happens so fast and not engaging with the fear and certainty around it.

I’d like to be part of group 2 and wrote a blog post around this topic:
[AI will make our jobs easier and not replace them](/blog/ai-will-make-our-jobs-easier-not-replace-them).

I’m really curious how all of this will turn out. If you’re interested in
reading a few interesting and inspiring blog posts about this, here’s a small
list:

- [Neither artificial, nore intelligent](https://hidde.blog/artificial-nor-intelligent/)
- [Pausing AI Developments Isn't Enough. We Need to Shut it All Down](https://time.com/6266923/ai-eliezer-yudkowsky-open-letter-not-enough/)
- [I for one welcome our GPT overlords co-workers](https://webdirections.org/blog/i-for-one-welcome-our-gpt-overlords-co-workers/)
- [The Age of AI has begun](https://www.gatesnotes.com/The-Age-of-AI-Has-Begun)

## 👨🏻‍💻 Work

Work-wise this month was quite **diversified**. I liked it a lot. I refactored a
big project to use TypeScript everywhere, which felt amazing. It made me more
confident to apply changes to the project. I’ve done some rather complex stuff
in this project and used plain JavaScript.

I don’t know how I managed to not break too much without using the proper types.
But now it feels much safer and better to implement new features.

On another project, I built features for a client that users had wished for a
long time. It felt really good to finally be able to give them the things they
were missing and to make both the client and the users happy.

Besides that, I’m **integrating AI** in the form of Chat-GPT and GitHub Copilot
more and more into my workflow. It’s great to explore the possibilities to make
my work more productive. I will write a more in-depth blog post about this soon.

## 📝 Blog Posts of the Month

I had a lot of fun writing blog posts last month. So here is the list of the
posts of March 2023:

- [What is prop drilling and how to avoid it](/blog/what-is-prop-drilling-and-how-to-avoid-it)
- [AI will make our jobs easier and not replace them](/blog/ai-will-make-our-jobs-easier-not-replace-them)
- [Developer Diaries 10](/blog/developer-diaries-10)

The prop drilling post is one I’ve had for a long time in my backlog. I had the
basic idea for it, but only last month did I get inspired by a lot of discussion
around the topic and finally write about it. So I’m pleased about that one.

The one about AI not taking our jobs was one of my most spontaneous ones. As I
already wrote in the introduction of this post, it’s the hot topic number one,
and all the news around made me write down my thoughts about it.

## 🎓 TIL Posts of the month

Here are the Today-I-learned posts of March 2023:

- [CSS Scroll Snap](/today-i-learned/scroll-snap)
- [React Server Components](/today-i-learned/react-server-components)
- [SVG Drawing Animation](/today-i-learned/svg-drawing-animation)
- [Vercel Cron Jobs](/today-i-learned/vercel-cron-jobs)

## 🏡 Life

We had a weekend getaway to the Lake of Constance. Unfortunately, the weather
was typical April weather, so we had everything from rain, storm, and sunshine
to cloudy. But that didn’t bother us too much. We had a great time eating good
food, walking along the lakeside, and just hanging out on our hotel balcony,
reading.

**Sometimes we don’t need to go too far to have a good time**. Just a small
change of scenery is enough to shake things up, get inspired again, and change
curtains.

## 🏋🏻‍♀️ Fitness

No longer living in a crowded city surrounded by hills means I’m having fun
running again. In only 20 minutes, I’m in the forest, which feels so good.

I ran over 15km for the first time in ten years and had no knee pain. What an
achievement.

I also love the combination of bodyweight strength workouts 2x a week and
filling the rest of the week with what I want to do spontaneously and depending
on the time I have, like core workouts, pilates, running, and biking. The
combination of everything that I enjoy is great.

## 📚 Reading

I managed to finish two books this month:

- [Mittagsstunde - Dörte Hansen](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40655908-mittagsstunde)

A book about people living on a small island on the north coast of Germany, who
have the typical struggles of people in general and a lot of lessons on life are
told. Great book!

- [The Border (Power of the Dog #3) - Don Winslow](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38376040-the-border)

The third book of the Power of the Dog series. I read the first two last year
and anticipated reading the last one of the series because I didn’t want it to
end. I almost couldn’t put the book aside. It’s cruel and brutal to read but
also, on the other hand, very thrilling.

## 🕹Video Games

I saw a video of the new Zelda game for the Switch and dug back onto Breath of
the Wild. I played it the last time in November of 2018. Crazy!

## 🎙Podcasts

Listened to an episode of Wes’ and Scotts
Podcast [Syntax.fm](http://syntax.fm/). A person asked if they could learn web
dev at the age of 47, which was super interesting to listen to.
