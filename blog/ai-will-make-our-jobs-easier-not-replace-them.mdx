I firmly believe that AI will make our software developer jobs easier and not
replace them. In this blog post, I will talk about the fear and uncertainty
around AI and how it will change our jobs.

### ChatGPT-4 is here <a id="chatgpt-4-is-here"></a>

ChatGPT-4 got released recently, and everyone is talking about it.
[OpenAI says it is more accurate, creative, and collaborative than the previous iteration](https://openai.com/product/gpt-4).

Watching this evolution of AI and how it might change everything in such a short
time is **mindblowing**. But on the other hand, many people are **worried**
about what will happen to their job when AI can do everything better and faster
than humans.

[New research](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.10130.pdf) by OpenAI, Open Research,
and the University of Pennsylvania has revealed which jobs are most at risk of
being automated by AI.

I understand the concerns around this topic. However, it seems like AI might
already **replace** illustrators because so many startups get created which
offer their users image generation services.

### The end of front-end development <a id="the-end-of-front-end-development"></a>

In addition to his, I stumbled over this article by Josh Comeau,
[the end of front-end development](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/blog/the-end-of-frontend-development/).
Although it's a very clickbaity title, it's a very interesting read, and I agree
with the author and share his beliefs.

But, contrary to the title, the author explains that AI **won't be the end of
front-end development** as we know it.

He shares several reasons why AI won't replace developer jobs. I've already
talked about most of them with other developers, friends, and colleagues.

> It's so funny that I wrote about this in 2021 when GitHub Copilot was

First and foremost, it's astonishing to see that
[ChatGPT can build simple websites from a hand-drawn sketch](https://twitter.com/rowancheung/status/1635744529587359756).
But, as Josh also puts it, that's a job we've seen being done by other tools
already for a long time. To build such simple websites, so many tools have been
available for years, yet web developers continue to exist.

I'm currently working on a large project which includes two different APIs and
several services in separate repositories. I'm primarily working on feature
improvements there and fixing bugs stretching through several services.

I always think about **how AI will be able to do this job for me**. We're
talking about hundreds of files and thousands of lines of code. So there's a
huge difference between generating simple apps and websites and working on a
large project with many services.

So I don't think AI can do my job soon. We're a very long way from that.

> [ChatGPT4 produces misinformation more frequently and more persuasively than its predecessor](https://www.newsguardtech.com/misinformation-monitor/march-2023/).
> so there is still a lot of room for improvement.

But I'm also **not scared** at all. On the contrary, I'm very excited about the
future of AI and how it will change our jobs. For example, I think there will be
more and better ways to integrate AI into our work which will lead to
**increased productivity and value**.

Josh also states in his article that we might **delegate** tasks to AI, but we
will still need to understand how it works and how to use it, and I agree.

### Ways to integrate AI into your developer workflow <a id="ways-to-integrate-ai-into-your-developer-workflow"></a>

To summarize the thoughts from above, I think it's **time to be excited about
AI** and not be scared and fear the loss of our jobs. To encourage this, I want
to share a few ways how we can **integrate AI into our developer workflow**
already.

#### GitHub Copilot <a id="github-copilot"></a>

GitHub Copilot is a great example of this. It's already two years old, and many
developers have already integrated it into their workflow.

If you haven't heard of it, it's an **AI-powered coding** assistant that can be
integrated via an extension into your IDE, like VSCode. It can provide code
suggestions based on your already written code or write the complete
functionality of a function for you if you give it a descriptive name.

It was free at first but now costs around 20$ a month, but I think it's worth
it.

It helps me to **increase my productivity**. It provides me code solutions
matching the context I'm in and based on the already written code. It writes
tedious and repetitive code for me. This also helps to reduce errors.

I always think about a problem, figure out a way to solve it, and write out the
base layout and skeleton, and GitHub Copilot fills out the details, which I then
tweak to my needs and preferences.

#### ChatGPT <a id="chatgpt"></a>

Besides GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT can also be integrated in so many ways into your
workflow already to increase your productivity and value created.

One example is to use it to **write tests**. You give it the code of a
component, for example, and it will figure out every behavior and scenario this
component is in and write useful tests for it.

Another use-case is to use it to **write documentation**. I haven't tried this
yet, so I'm not sure how well this works, but from what we've seen already, it
should be very helpful with this.

AI-powered tools like ChatGPT can also be integrated into your developer
workflow when you try to **learn a new language**. For example, imagine you're a
front-end developer who works on a project where the backend is written in Go.
You'd like to get a better understanding of a specific backend service because
you want to work with the data that gets manipulated there. But you haven't used
Go much before.

ChatGPT can help you to understand the code and the concepts of Go and answer
your questions. So it helps to increase your productivity, and you won't need to
bother your colleagues with questions all the time.

It's also great to get a better understanding of certain concepts of a new
framework or new additions to a language that you haven't used before.

Finally, I often use ChatGPT to write specific functions that I didn't know how
to write. For example, recently, it wrote me **csv to json compile function in
node with typescript**. I could've written it myself with some research, but it
was **faster** to just ask ChatGPT to do it for me.

### Conclusion <a id="conclusion"></a>

To sum it up, I think it's **time to be excited about AI**, not be scared, and
engage with the fear and uncertainty around it. Instead, I think it's time to
**embrace it** and **integrate it into our developer workflow** to increase our
productivity and the value created.

Nobody can predict the future, but I think it's a healthy habit to welcome a
tool like this that brings a lot of change and make the best out of it.

So far, these tools are making our job as developers easier, which I like a lot.
Maybe I'm entirely wrong about this, and in a few years, we'll all turn into
farmers, and AI will take over our jobs. But as long as it doesn't happen, I'm
happy to embrace the change.
