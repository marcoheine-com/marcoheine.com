In a recent project, I used TypeScript Type Guards so much that I wanted to
write a blog post about them with great examples and why I like them. They've
helped me prevent errors and make my code safer and more reliable.

## What are TypeScript Type Guards <a name="what-are-typescript-type-guards"></a>

TypeScript Type Guards are used when you only want to allow a specific type in a
function, for example. The need for something like this derives from the fact
that only this particular type has the values you can work with further.

If you'd use a function that's manipulating data in some sort on a type that
would be **missing** these values, you will run into **errors**.

So TypeScript Type Guards are one of the first and best ways to ensure you only
process further in your programming logic with relevant data.

## How to write a great Type Guard <a name="how-to-write-a-great-type-guard"></a>

Let's learn more about Type Guards by looking at an example. To create one, you
have to write a function whose return type is aÂ **type predicate**. The
predicate has the form: `parameterName is Type`.

Imagine you are getting some data from an API of your headless CMS. In your CMS,
users can set the fields of a link element there. The link element would
translate into a TypeScript Interface which would look like this:

```typescript
interface FilledLink {
  url: string
  isExternal: boolean
  isTargetBlank: boolean
}
```

But they can also leave it empty and not add it in. This would look something
like that:

```typescript
interface EmptyLink {
  url: undefined
}
```

When we consume this data via API, we want to ensure we only work with it if
it's a filled link and not `null`. So we only want to go further when it has the
type of `FilledLink`.

Otherwise, if we didn't care and would render a link field in React, we would
run into errors. We would access the URL field, which can be `undefined`, and
our user interface would break.

So here's what a Type Guard for this scenario would look like:

```tsx
const isFilledLink = (link: EmptyLink | FilledLink): link is FilledLink => {
  return link?.url !== undefined
}
```

Let's have a closer look on what happens here. We define a function who takes in
a parameter of type `EmptyLink | FilledLink`. The return type is a type
predicate, which is a function that returns a boolean. The boolean is used to
determine if the type is `FilledLink` or not.

This ensures, that we can work on with the url field, because we know it's not
`undefined` anymore.

This is called a **custom Type Guard** or a **user-defined Type Guard**. It's
the most powerful because you can customize it all the way you want.

## Built-in Type Guards <a name="built-in-type-guards"></a>

There are also built-in Type Guards in TypeScript. The following exist:

- [typeof](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html#typeof-type-guards)
- [instanceof narrowing](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html#instanceof-narrowing)

- [in](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html#the-in-operator-narrowing)

- [equality narrowing](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html#equality-narrowing)

I've linked them all to the official TypeScript documentation, so you can read
more about them there. I will write a detailled blog post about these soon, so
stay tuned!

That's it about TypeScript Type Guards, in this case specifically about
user-defined or custom Type Guards!
