  Vercel recently introduced storage. A suite of serverless storage solutions
  like KV, Postgres and Blob.
---

On May the first, Vercel announced a new product: **storage on Vercel**. Once
again the web community is **divided** into two big camps.

The first one **loves** this new product and can't wait to use it and ship their
products with it. The second one has a lot of **criticism** to share.

In this post, I'll share the thoughts of both camps, but first, let's have a
look what they announced.

### Vercel serverless storage solutions

Vercel storage is a suite of **serverless storage solutions**. The first one is
**Vercel KV**, a durable Redis database. The second is **Vercel Postgres**.
Vercel partnered with Neon here to introduce a serverless Postgres database.

And the third one is **Vercel blob**, which is file storage on the edge. So a
direct replacement for services like S3, which developers have used heavily for
use cases where you wanted to upload any kind of unstructured data.

What makes the release of this new product of storage on Vercel so interesting
is that all of these three storage solutions run **serverless**. So you don't
need an actual backend and an API layer to communicate to your database.

With the new `app` directory in Next.js, which makes use of React Server
Components, things get even crazier. By leveraging React Server Components, you
can even **directly communicate with your database from your components**.

Here's the example, Vercel shared to showcase their serverless postgres:

```jsx
import { sql } from 'vercel-postgres'
import { redirect } from 'next/navigation'

async function create(formData: FormData) {
  'use server'

  const { rows } = await sql`
    INSERT INTO products (name)
    VALUES ($formData.get('name')})
  `
  redirect(`/products/${rows[0].slug}`)
}

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <form onSubmit={create}>
      <input
        type="text"
        name="name"
      />
      <button type="submit">Create</button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

Let's have a look at what happens here.

- We have a `Page` component, which renders a form.
- When the form is submitted, the `create` function is called.
- The `create` function is declared as a server function by using `use server`.
  This ensures the function is only executed on the server and can't be imported
  from client components.
- Inside the `create` function, we use the `sql` tag from vercel-postgres to
  insert a new product into our database.
- And then, we redirect the user to the newly created product page.

A lot of people pointed out that this might be prone to **SQL injection**. But
it's not a regular template string getting inserted into the DB. Instead it's a
tagged template call, and the `sql` function does very likely sanitize the
input.

### Why people love serverless

Many people are really excited about this. The **developer experience** to build
a website that makes use of a database to store data where the frontend can
query and mutate the data directly has never been easier, in my opinion.

With serverless being a hot topic for years now, and the discussion if this is
the way to go vs. persisting on a separate backend, the release of Vercel
storage is another step towards the serverless future.

### Many Developers still love their backend

Next to the excited crowd are a lot of people who raise some **serious
concerns**. The first one, and probably the biggest one, is that Vercel storage
is just a **wrapper** around other services where you **pay a lot** to have a
better DX.

[Ottomated](https://twitter.com/Ottomated_) made a
[comparison table](https://service-markup.vercel.app/) around the costs of
Vercel storage vs. using other services. Also it's the number one topic, people
talk about on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35774730).

Next to that, a lot of people are concerned about having to pay very high bills
suddenly due to unexpected traffic spikes.

Lee Robinson did a great job of clarifying these two big critical points
[in this tweet](https://twitter.com/leeerob/status/1653636931291602953). He
talks about how Vercel can be more transparent about the usage controls and the
pricing.

The key takeway is that it's hard to find a **good balance** between a hobby
project not wanting to pay a sudden huge bill vs. a business not wanting there
website goes offline because they've exceeded its limits.

Another negative point I often hear is that Vercel is driving us away from open
source and getting more into vendor lock-in. Guillermo Rauch, the CEO of Vercel,
[argues against it](https://twitter.com/rauchg/status/1653523458616340483), by
saying that "everything about the platform remains composable".

He points out that "serverless databases are cool, but most of the world's
backend and data already exists and are not moving anytime soon."

I find it really interesting to follow these developments around serverless and
I'm curious to see how this will evolve in the future. I will definitely try out
Vercel storage soon, but also keep an eye on the critical points.
