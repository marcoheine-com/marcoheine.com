If you ever were to be asked to build an E-Commerce website for a client, what’s
the first thing that comes to mind? **Shopify**, right? Recently, I built my
first website with Shopify Hydrogen, and in this blog post, I’d like to share
how to get started with that.

## Going headless: Next.js Commerce vs Hydrogen <a name="going-headless-nextjs-commerce-vs-hydrogen"></a>

When I figured out the **requirements** for this website with my client, I
decided to use the **headless** approach of building this E-Commerce site
instead of going with a Shopify template and some third-party apps. Don’t get me
wrong: using the whole Shopify platform is great. You can ship a website fast.

But my reasons for not using it and going headless were the following:

- I wasn’t familiar with [Liquid](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/liquid), so I’d
  have to learn that first to customize and enhance any theme
- The client had a custom design, which I knew I would build faster with the
  tech stack I’m familiar with
- I needed more freedom and more custom functionality

I researched a bit and found two possible ways to tackle this project. As a
regular React and Next.js user (most recent websites I built using Next.js), one
option was using the [Next.js Commerce template](https://nextjs.org/commerce).
The other option was using Shopify’s own React-Framework
[Hydrogen](https://hydrogen.shopify.dev/).

My first instinct was to go with Next.js commerce. I heard a few things about
Hydrogen not being used that much so far. But then I noticed that **Shopify
bought Remix** last year, and a few months ago, they released
[Hydrogen V2](https://hydrogen.shopify.dev/roadmap/) based on Remix! I built one
website the previous year with Remix, and I liked it a lot. The concept of
[actions and loaders](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/pages/philosophy#serverclient-model)
automatically clicked for me.

Besides that, Next.js Commerce felt a little too much developing on **shiny and
new cutting-edge technology**. Some big shops are using it, but I still wanted
to wait a bit before using the `App Router` and `React Server Components` in
production.

Therefore, I decided to go with Hydrogen, and in this blog post, I’ll document
the process of building an E-Commerce Website with Hydrogen v2 and Sanity!

## The main components <a name="the-main-components"></a>

Here’s a quick rundown of the **main building blocks** for this site:

- As mentioned above, I used headless Shopify with Hydrogen based on Remix to
  build the front-end, query of the data and run mutations.
- I used the headless CMS Sanity to gather all the content unrelated to
  products.
- And for styling, I used TailwindCSS.

With these three building blocks I should be ready to go!

## Opinions <a name="opinions"></a>

The team from Sanity built a
[hydrogen sanity demo shop](https://github.com/sanity-io/hydrogen-sanity-demo),
which was a **huge help** to get this website going. They defined some opinions
as general rules for their shop. I liked this idea a lot, so I decided to
implement this as well. Here are the opinions on this project:

- Shopify is the primary source of truth for products and collections
- Sanity is the primary source of truth for editorial content
- Product pages can be enhanced with content in Sanity

## Create a shop on Shopify <a name="create-a-shop-on-shopify"></a>

With the main tech figured out and the opinions formed, it’s time to dive in.
First of all, you need a Shopify shop. I won’t get into detail on how to set
that up because the Shopify docs do a great job of explaining this step in
depth. The important thing here is you **can’t use a development store** when
you’re building with Hydrogen.

## Install Hydrogen App <a name="install-hydrogen-app"></a>

After you've created your shop in Shopify, you have to add the Hydrogen App to
our Shopify store if the shop is set up. This enables you to use the Storefront
API. It gives you access tokens and lets you query your products and
collections.

For this, you have to head over to the Shopify App store, search for Hydrogen,
and install the app.

  height={1308}
/>

After that, you can configure it in Shopify to get your access token for the
Storefront API and so on.

## Create a new hydrogen project <a name="create-a-new-hydrogen-project"></a>

Now, the actual developing part starts. On your machine, open a terminal and run
the following command:

```jsx
 npm create @shopify/hydrogen@latest
```

It runs a setup to create a new Hydrogen Shopify website. It offers **a lot of
options**. And if you want to, you can have a **very opinionated** project
setup.

First, it links automatically to your Shopify account and connects to your
existing store if you’ve already set up one. You can give your shop a name,
select if you want to use `JavaScript` or `TypeScript`, and choose which styling
library you want. For me, that was TailwindCSS, so I added that directly.

Finally, you can choose if you want to have routes and more core functionality
immediately set up.

## Start developing with Hydrogen <a name="start-developing-with-hydrogen"></a>

With the project setup, you’re ready to **start developing** with Hydrogen.

If you’ve chosen the option to have pre-configured routes and core
functionality, you will notice that you have an almost complete functional shop
ready to run. That’s amazing!

The Shopify team set **everything necessary**, like fetching collections and
recommended products, creating product detail pages, adding products to the
cart, searching the page, account management, and more! Wow!

I think that’s pretty awesome. They are the experts in building web shops, and
they know **what basic functionality every shop needs**. So why not prepare it
already in the best possible way? This made my job much easier, and I was very
thankful.

So, with the essential building blocks set up, now is the time to tweak your
shop the way you want it to look, implement your custom design, add more
functionality, and adjust it to your needs.

## Integrate Sanity <a name="integrate-sanity"></a>

After finishing everything Shopify product and collections related, it was time
to integrate Sanity as a headless CMS for the editorial content as stated in the
Opinions.

First of all, I installed
[hydrogen-sanity](https://github.com/sanity-io/hydrogen-sanity), which adds a
Sanity Client to the Remix Context. The Sanity team did a great job building
this integration, and it’s cool that these products are so intertangled.

```jsx
npm i hydrogen-sanity
```

`Hydrogen-sanity` enables you to fetch content from Sanity in Remix actions and
loaders using their query client. It also allows you to have a live preview.
After the installation, follow the `Readme` to update your `server.ts` and set
up the `ENV` variables.

Now it’s time to install and run Sanity. There are multiple options available.
You can either get started with a clean template. Or you can choose to use the
**Shopify template**, which means already pre-configured `schemas` for
everything you might need for a Shopify store.

```jsx
npx sanity@latest
```

You can take another _optional_ step when working with Shopify and Sanity. You
can install the
[Sanity Connect app](https://www.sanity.io/docs/sanity-connect-for-shopify) in
your Shopify Store. This app enables you to sync all your products and
collections to Sanity.

<Image
  src="/images/sanity-connect-shopify-app-store.webp"
  alt="A Screenshot of the Sanity Connect App in the Shopify App Store"
  width={1504}
  height={1308}
/>

In Sanity, you can then **enrich** the content for your product and collections
pages. You can also reference your products and collections on every Sanity
page, which is a fantastic feature!

## Deployment with Oxygen <a name="deployment-with-oxygen"></a>

When you’re done developing, Shopify offers the opportunity to use their hosting
service, [Oxygen](https://shopify.dev/docs/custom-storefronts/oxygen), for free.
To get that up and going, you only have to **connect** your Hydrogen App in
Shopify with your **GitHub Account**.

Shopify will then open a Pull Request, which adds a `yaml` file with the
deployment instructions. After that, every git push triggers a deployment. It
could not be easier to deploy your store!

## Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>

So these are the steps you have to take to build an **E-Commerce website with
Shopify Hydrogen and Sanity**. I liked the process a lot. The documentation is
excellent. Additionally, the Hydrogen Sanity Demo was a perfect example to have
a sneak peek occasionally and use that as a guideline.

I also liked that you can get a lot of **core functionality pre-configured**,
like routes, handling and adding products to your cart, and so on. This speeds
up the process of building an E-Commerce website by a lot. For my next shop,
I’ll definitely use this stack again!
