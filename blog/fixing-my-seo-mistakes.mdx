The optimization of websites for search engines has always been a mystery to me.
There seemed to be so many factors that get used to calculate how a page gets
ranked on a search engine like google. I even learned how page ranks get
calculated during my master's degree.

Still, it was always a bit hard for me to understand what to optimize for,
concerning keywords and content.

One thing though where SEO is very clear to me is from a technical point of
view. I know that Google ranks websites better that are fast, accessible, and in
great shape technology-wise.

Thanks to different tools and my knowledge as a web developer I know what a
website needs to have to succeed in this area. Still, I neglected that for too
long on my website.

Problems and mistakes I would never have on client websites popped up on my site
and I needed to fix them. Here are all the SEO mistakes I had on my website and
how I fixed them, so you can avoid these pitfalls.

## Multiple h1 <a name="multiple-h1"></a>

I’ll start with the easiest one. I had several h1 on my pages! I don’t know how
that happened, I guess I didn’t control it at all. Having a hierarchy of
headings is crucial and I’m a little embarrassed that this happened on my site.

### How I fixed it:

I used different tools to check the order of my headings on all pages and fixed
them. I learned that having correct headings is not that more of a factor in
getting ranked in search engines. Still, it is mandatory to make your
website **accessible**. People who use a **screen reader** are **dependent** on
a correct heading order to grasp the content of your website. Wave is a great
tool to improve on that.

## Trailing slashes <a name="trailing-slashes"></a>

My site is built with Gatsby and deployed and hosted with Netlify. Netlify has
this option to **pretty print** URLs, which adds trailing slashes to every link.

But I did not add them everywhere in my code in Gatsby. This resulted in a lot
of **301 redirects** where links without trailing slashes were redirected to
them with it. That’s unnecessary and bad for SEO.

### How I fixed it:

There were **two ways** to fix this problem. The first one would have been
to **disable** the option in Netlify. This would have removed all the extra
added trailing slashes. But it would have also left me with a great mixture of
URLs with trailing slashes and without.

Since the majority of my URLs have them and Google also indexed them with
trailing slashes, I chose the second option to fix this problem. This meant
adding trailing slashes to every link I set in my code. It was a bit tedious but
necessary and now I try to be consistent with it.

## Canonical links <a name="canonical-links"></a>

I did not set up canonical links at all on my site which is a big mistake. I
often try to spread my blog posts on different platforms besides my website,
like <a href="https://dev.to/mkuehb/react-performance-quick-wins-7-easy-ways-to-improve-your-react-performance-part-2-4j3c" target="_blank">dev.to
&#8599;</a> and medium, to reach more people.

Not having set up correct canonical tags is a problem. If search engines look at
pages with the same content, they can't find out which of the resources is the
original one. This means my website could get a **penalty** for
distributing **duplicate content**, although it’s my content!

### How I fixed it:

I set up canonical links on my website and double-checked them on every page. I
used the plugin

<a
  href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-react-helmet-canonical-urls/"
  target="_blank"
>
  gatsby-plugin-react-helmet-canonical-urls &#8599;
</a> to do that. It’s a great plugin that makes it easy to set up canonical links.

## Canonical points to redirect <a name="canonical-points-to-redirect"></a>

I had a lot of canonical links that pointed to 301 redirects. This is a
combination of the two problems I explained before. I had URLs that
were **upperCase** in my code, like this
one /today-i-learned/performance-and-useMemo/

Once again the Netlify URL pretty print kicks in and tells the browser hey the
actual URL is /today-i-learned/performance-and-usememo, so it’s not the same and
we need a redirect! Oh no.

The problem here is, that the canonical URL stays the same (with upperCase) and
that’s bad for SEO because we get another unnecessary redirect.

### How I fixed it:

I made sure that all my URLs are lowercase. It’s a bit hard to get Netlify to
acknowledge these changes so I had to delete the upperCase file, remove it from
git and re-add it later with the lowercase URL.

## 404 - broken links <a name="broken-links"></a>

I’ve you’re blogging for some years, you may link to websites that don’t exist
anymore, changed the URL, part of the URL, etc. I’ve had a lot of these issues.

### How I fixed it:

It used a tool to analyze all blog post links and then updated or removed them.
I thought about writing a **CronJob** which clicks on all the links on a newly
published blog post. But in the end, it was not worth the effort.

## Missing meta tags (and other stuff in the head) <a name="missing-meta-tags"></a>

The most important meta tags for me always were the **media-query** one,
the **utf-8**, and the **description**.

Of course, I knew that there were way more but I didn’t know which made a huge
difference for SEO. For example, I didn’t set the open graph tags and Twitter
card tags at all on my site.

### How I fixed it:

Once again I used a tool to analyze the head of my site and set all meta tags in
my SEO component in Gatsby.

## Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>

There are a lot of easy mistakes one can make, without even knowing about them.
Take your time to inspect your website in the **dev tools**, check out the head
tag, check if all meta tags are there, and set them to the correct values.

Use different tools to check your website. There are a lot of them out there.
I’ll write a separate blog post soon on what kind of tools I recommend and use.

Fixing **a11y mistakes** also means SEO. First, we should optimize our websites
to the best for our users. Doing the best we can to make
them **accessible** and **fast**. Google recognizes if we succeeded in doing so
and rewards us with a better page rank.
