  React performance.

In part 1 of this react performance quick-wins series, we already learned about
the following:

- [Always use a key when mapping and no index](/blog/7-easy-ways-to-improve-your-react-performance-part-1/#keys)
- [Use React.Fragments instead of divs as parent element](/blog/7-easy-ways-to-improve-your-react-performance-part-1/#fragments)
- [One useState hook instead of multiple for connected data](/blog/7-easy-ways-to-improve-your-react-performance-part-1/#usestate)

The second part of this series brings you another **4 great quick-wins** you can
apply directly to your code and improve your performance

This Post is Part 2 of a series.

## <a name='avoid-anonymous-funcs'></a>Avoid anonymous functions

It's easy to use an anonymous function when you want to add a quick callback
function to a component.

```jsx
import * as React from 'react'

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <button onClick={() => console.log('Button clicked')}>Click me!</button>
  )
}

export default MyComponent
```

But if you're on the lookout for a quick performance win, that's something you
can avoid.

Anonymous functions aren't assigned an identifier like const/let/var. This means
they **are not persistent** whenever this functional component gets rendered
again. So JavaScript has to **create them again and again,** on every rerender.

There is an easy way to solve this. You can change it to a **named function**
and move it outside of the component.

```jsx
import * as React from 'react'

const handleClick = () => {
  console.log('Button clicked')
}

const MyComponent = () => {
  return <button onClick={handleClick}>Click me!</button>
}

export default MyComponent
```

That's it for quick-win number 4: avoid anonymous functions!

## <a name='defining-objects'></a>Define objects outside of your component

Here comes quick-win number 5. Something similar as described above can be
applied to objects.

If you define an object as an object literal and pass it in as props, this
object will have to be recreated on every rerender.

```jsx
import * as React from 'react'

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div style={{ textAlign: 'center', fontSize: '14px' }}>
      This is the text of my component.
    </div>
  )
}

export default MyComponent
```

Instead, define your object outside of the component. Now it is created once on
the initial render and not being touched on every rerender.

```jsx
import * as React from 'react'

const DIV_STYLES = {
  fontSize: '14px',
  textAlign: 'center',
}

const MyComponent = () => {
  return <div style={DIV_STYLES}>This is the text of my component.</div>
}

export default MyComponent
```

Performance quick-win, whoop whoop! ðŸš€

## <a name='lazy-suspense'></a>React.lazy and React.Suspense

With `React.lazy`, you can "lazy load" your components. This means your
component is only rendered when it is truly needed and not loaded unnecessarily.

The less you need to load, the better your performance!

This can easily be combined with React.Suspense for rendering some fallback
content.

I wrote a whole Today-I-learned post about this topic; check it out here:
[Today I learned: React Suspense lazy-loading](/today-i-learned/react-suspense-lazy-loading/)

That's also a great way to improve your React performance without too much
effort.

## <a name='virtualized-lists'></a>Virtualized lists

If you've worked with long lists or tables with many rows in React, you know how
much this can impact your performance. This is because you have to render a lot
of content, usually many divs.

We already learned that too many DOM nodes are not a good idea. Also updates and
rerenders can be painful because they take just way too long.

With virtualized lists, only the list items that are actually in the viewport
are rendered. That's pretty cool. But how does this work? Don't worry; you won't
have to build this yourself. There are already excellent tools out there that do
the job for you.

Check out [react-virtualized](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized) by
Brian Vaughn.

It's pretty easy to use, and you don't need to worry about displaying long lists
and tables anymore.

So that's it; these are my **7 easy ways to improve your React performance**.
