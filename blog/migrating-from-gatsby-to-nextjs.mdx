Recently I decided to migrate my website from Gatsby to Next.js. There were
several reasons for it, which I'll explain in detail below, but the main reason
was that I primarily work with Next.js in clients' projects, so it made sense to
me to migrate my website to it.

Next.js provides fantastic documentation on what you need to do to migrate
successfully from Gatsby no Next.js.

Nevertheless, there are some things I wish I had known when getting into it. In
this blog post, I'll document everything about the process, what to look out
for, and what I've struggled with to make your migration to Next.js a
**success**.

## <a name="my-reasons-to-migrate-from-gatsby-to-nextjs"></a> My reasons for migrating from Gatsby to Next.js

My main reason for migrating from Gatsby to Next.js was **convenience**. In
client projects, I solemnly use Next.js. The last project, where we used Gatsby,
is two years old. I'm just much more used to it and faster.

I can't say anything terrible about Gatsby. On the contrary, when I chose to use
it initially for my website, I was pleased with it. The ton of plugins enabled
great features and improved my website a lot.

But at the point where I am now, I don't like the GraphQL approach anymore, and
I'm happier with the `getStaticProps` approach by Next.js.

Also, I couldn't get Typescript to run on the project of my website. This is not
Gatsby's fault, but it was another reason for me to migrate.

Using Gatsby with the ton of plugins felt great at first. I needed a sitemap so
I installed a plugin for it. If you want to have an RSS feed here, add this
plugin. But with time, **it felt like relying heavily on jQuery years ago**. A
lot of stuff is happening under the hood, it works, but I don't understand it.

Next.js doesn't use a plugin system and includes more in the framework itself.
So you can play more with it yourself, which I like today. So these are the
reasons I chose to migrate from Gatsby to Next.js. So now, let's talk about the
steps to achieve that goal!

## Updating package.json and dependencies <a name="updating-packagejson-and-dependencies"></a>

To **get started** with the migration, the first step you have to take is to
**delete** all the packages from your `package.json` with Gatsby in their name.

<Image
  src="/images/migration-nextjs-diff.webp"
  alt="This image shows the Diff of the package.json when I removed every gatsby related package"
  width={463}
  height={391}
/>

Also, make sure to delete Gatsby-specific scripts from the `package.json`. After
getting rid of all the Gatsby stuff, we can get into Next.js.

Before installing Next.js, you have to check your React Version. I was still on
17.x.x. This meant upgrading React first!

```bash
npm i react@latest react-dom@latest
```

Now we are ready for Next.js. Install it and add the Next.js
specific **scripts** in your package.json.

```bash
npm i next
```

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "next dev",
  "build": "next build",
  "start": "next start",
},
```

My Gatsby site didn't have **TypeScript**, so I also added this. First, you have
to create a `tsconfig.json`. Next.js will automatically fill it. Then install
Typescript and the types for react, react-dom and node.

```bash
npm i typescript @types/react @types/react-dom @types/node
```

It's amazing how Next.js automatically reacts to that and configures TS for your
Next.js project. Nice!

## Static assets and compiled output <a name="static-assets-and-compiled-output"></a>

When we have the packages and dependencies in place, it's time to get into the
project.

In Gatsby, the **public** directory has a different meaning than in Next.js. In
Gatsby, it's the place where the compiled output lands. In Next.js, it's used
for static assets.

So we have to adjust that. The best way to resolve that, according to the
Next.js docs, is by removing `.cache` and `public` from `.gitignore`, deleting
both folders, and renaming the static folder to public.

Then add the `.next` folder to your `.gitignore`.

In Gatsby, everything is inside a src folder. If you start a new Next.js
project, they are not using an src folder, and everything is on root. I got rid
of the src folder, but it's not mandatory.

## Creating Routes <a name="creating-routes"></a>

**Page routes** work differently in Gatsby and Next.js. In Gatsby, you have to
use the `createPages` function in `gatsby-node` and use a template file for
every page. In Next.js, you use **folders** to create routes for pages.

Therefore I created a pages directory and moved every template file as a page
inside of it.

I followed the documentation for dynamic pages and used the bracket syntax and
`getStaticPaths`. It was straightforward to get the route creation to work.

<Image
  src="/images/nextjs-pages-folder.webp"
  alt="This image shows the pages folder with all the pages inside of it which is used to create routes in Next.js"
  width={358}
  height={455}
/>

## Styling <a name="styling"></a>

In Gatsby, **global CSS** files are imported in `gatsby-browser`. To use global
CSS in Next.js, you must create an `\_app.js` file and import it there.

```jsx
import '../styles/styles.css'
import '../styles/night-owl.min.css'
import type { AppProps } from 'next/app'

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return <Component {...pageProps} />
}

export default MyApp
```

I also took the opportunity to migrate from styled-components to TailwindCSS. It
was complicated to use styled-components in Next.js, and I rarely use them in
client projects because I'm more productive with TailwindCSS.

## Links <a name="links"></a>

Both frameworks offer a **Link component**, but the syntax is slightly
different. Gatsby's Link has a `to` prop where you have to pass the URL in, and
in Next.js, it's called `href`. So I changed this everywhere and completed the
next step of the migration.

```diff
- <Link to="/blog/">Blog</Link>
+ <Link href="/blog/">Blog</Link>
```

## Data fetching <a name="data-fetching"></a>

**Data fetching** is the topic that shows the most significant difference
between Gatsby and Next.js.

In Gatsby, the default way to fetch data is to use **GraphQL**. In Next.js, you
have different options: `getServersideProps` for **server-side rendering** or
with `getStaticProps` and `getStaticPaths` for **static site generation**.

To migrate the data fetching process, you have to delete every GraphQL query and
integrate your preferred data fetching method in Next.js. For me, this meant
adding the `getStaticProps` function in every page file and querying there for
the data needed.

I'll write a different blog post about how I migrated from querying my blog
posts in Gatsby with GraphQL to doing it in Next.js. It's an interesting topic
on it's on, and it would make this blog post too big. As soon as I publish it,
I'll link it here!

## Images and Image Optimization <a name="images-and-image-optimization"></a>

In Gatsby, I used the `GatsbyImage` Component heavily for responsive images.
Next.js has something similar. The main difference is that it doesn't optimize
images at build time as Gatsby does, but on-demand as users request them.

You can import it from `next/image`, and the usage is pretty straightforward.

```jsx
import Image from 'next/image'

return (
  // ...
  <Image
    alt="a picture of Marco Heine"
    src="/images/marco-heine.webp"
    className="mb-10 max-w-[300px] sm:mb-20"
  />
)

// ...
```

## Site metadata <a name="site-metadata"></a>

In Gatsby, you can define **metadata**, like the title or author, in a
gatsby-config.js file. This data can be queried via GraphQL. For the migration
to Next.js, you can move this data into a config.js file and import it whenever
needed.

## SEO <a name="seo"></a>

Gatsby encouraged everyone for a long time to use `react-helmet`. They have a
built-in solution now, but my project still used `react-helmet`. In Next.js, you
can use `next/head` and add every meta tag as children.

```jsx
import Head from 'next/head'

export const Head = () => {
  return (
    <Head>
      <title>Marco Heine's website</title>

      {/*  add meta tags here */}
    </Head>
  )
}
```

## Optional: Migrating from Netlify to Vercel

As all my client projects are hosted on Vercel, I also wanted to migrate my
website from Netlify to Vercel. This is **optional**. You can migrate your
website from Gatsby to Next.js and still host it on Netlify.

But if you decide to use Vercel, they also have
a [fantastic migration guide](https://vercel.com/guides/migrate-to-vercel-from-netlify%3E%5D).

## Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>

I don't know how long it took me to complete the migration. But it was a
**smooth process** from the beginning to the end. I had **no trouble** at any
time, and if you're also thinking about doing it, I recommend it.

I don't know if the Performance of my website improved much because I already
had high Lighthouse scores with Gatsby. But I took the time to change and
refactor some things independent of the migration, which made my website even
more **accessible and faster**.
