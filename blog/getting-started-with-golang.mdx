### How I got to know go

> "Wait, what? What's happening here? Your previous blog posts were all about
> frontend development, CSS JavaScript, React. Now this..go? What is it? And why
> are you blogging about it?"

If this new content on my blog confuses you a little, I'm sorry! A lot of new
things happened to me in the last months and one of them is, that I'm **taking a
closer look** on both (all?) sides of web development. Which includes working
with and learning more about **backend technologies**.

My first contact with everything else than frontend was in a project were we
worked with **NodeJS/Express** and **MongoDB**.

This granted me a lof ot knowledge on how all parts of a web application work
together. **From the frontend, to API Calls, middlewares, services, raw SQL and
to the database**.

In the project I'm working in right now, we're using **go** in the backend and
therefore I'm learning go!

And to make the most of it I will **document** everything I learn about go in
this blog post. So I have a place to come back to and look at when I forget
everything.

And maybe you can learn something from it too!

### So...go. What is it?

> Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple,
> reliable, and efficient software.

At least that's what it says about itself on its website. Let's see what
wikipeda has to say about go:

> Go is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google by
> Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. Go is syntactically similar to
> C, but with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and
> CSP-style concurrency. The language is often referred to as Golang because of
> its domain name, [golang.org](http://golang.org/), but the proper name is Go.

Ah that tells a bit more about it. Interesting! Now that we are behind the get
to know each other phase, let's see what **topics** I'll cover in this blog
post. As the title says it will be an absolute beginner introduction.

If I'm wrong about something or made mistakes, please let me know!

### <a name='packages'></a>packages, import, export

Every go program is made up of packages. You always have to have a **main
package**, where your app starts. You can **import** your own packages or one of
the hundreds of go packages.

A name (of a function, struct etc) is **exported** and therefore can be imported
if it begins with a capital letter.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

// is not exported
func main () {
	PrintStr()
}

// can be imported from other packages in your app
func PrintStr () {
	fmt.Printf("Hello World")
	fmt.Println(math.Pi)
}
```

### <a name='variables'></a> Variables

There are several ways to declare variables in go. The classic `var` lets you
declare one or more variables at once. The `const` lets you declare constant
variables. The `:=` shorthand lets you declare and initialize a variable at once
inside a function.

```go
var a = 10
const 1 = 10

// shorthand for declaring and initializing a a variable inside a function
a := 10
```

### <a name='functions'></a> Functions

A function in go can take **zero or more arguments**. The type of the input
parameter comes after the variable name. When the parameters have the same type
you can combine the type declaration.

The input parameters are followed by the return type.

A function can return any number of results. In go explizit returns are
required.

```go
func multiply (a, b int) int {
	return a * b
}

multiply(3, 6)
```

### <a name='data-types'></a> Data types

Surprise, surprise go has values like boolean, strings and integer. Here's a
list of all of them.

```go
bool

string

int  int8  int16  int32  int64
uint uint8 uint16 uint32 uint64 uintptr

byte // alias for uint8

rune // alias for int32
     // represents a Unicode code point

float32 float64

complex64 complex128
```

Variables declared without an initial value are given their zero value:

- `0` for numeric types,
- `false` for the boolean type, and
- `""` (the empty string) for strings

### <a name='for'></a> for

Coming from TypeScript, there is no such thing as the array methods map, reduce
or filter in go. The for loop is all you have.

A for loop consists of the following:

- an **init** statement; condition expression; **post** statement

There is no need for **parenthesis** surrounding the three components. The init
and post statements are **optional**.

The for loop can also be used as while().

```go
var a = 10

for i := 0; i < a; i++ {
	a += i
}
```

### <a name='if-else'></a> if, else

If, else is pretty straight forward in go. No parenthesis are needing
surrounding the condition.

```go
var a = 10

if a > 9 {
	fmt.Println(a)
}
```

### <a name='switch'></a> switch

A switch in go only runs the selected case, not all cases that follow. The
default case is **optional**.

The break statement is provided automatically.

You can combine expressions in the same case by using comma separation.

```go
switch time.Now().Weekday() {
    case time.Saturday, time.Sunday:
        fmt.Println("It's the weekend")
    default:
        fmt.Println("It's a weekday")
}
```

### <a name='struct'></a> struct

A struct is a typed collection of fields. Structs are **mutable**.

```go
type server struct {
	host          string
	port          string
}
server{"localhost", "8080"}

type person struct {
	name string
	age int
}
person{name: "Marco", age: 29}
```

### <a name='arrays'></a> arrays

Arrays are numbered sequences of elements of a specific length.

The following creates a variable a as an array of 10 integers.

```go
var a [10]int
```

In go arrays can not be resized, because the length is part of the type.

The built-in **len** method returns the length of an array.

```go
var names [3]string{"Tim", "Mandy", "Stefanie"}
len(names) // 2
```

### <a name='slices'></a> slices

Unlike arrays, slices have no specified length, so they are dynamically sized.
They are build on arrays but are more powerful and therefore more used than
arrays in go.

To create **dynamically** sized arrays (slices), you can use the **make**
function.

```go
// slice of type in with length 5
a := make([]int, 5)

// slice of type string with length 3
s := make([]string, 3)
```

Slices can also be build by slicing an existing array or slice. In the following
example, a slice is formed on the numbers array by specifying two indices, a low
and high bound.

```go
// array
numbers := [5]int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

// slice of numbers array
specificNumbers := names[0:3]
```

Its also possible to create **slices of slices.**

```go
board := [][]string{
		[]string{"_", "_", "_"},
		[]string{"_", "_", "_"},
		[]string{"_", "_", "_"},
	}
```

To enhance a slice, you can use the **append** function. This is one example of
what makes slices more powerful than arrays. Append returns a slice with one or
more new values.

```go
var s []int

append(s, 1, 3, 4, 5)
```

Slices can also be **copied**.

```go
s := make([]string, 5)

s[0] = "H"
s[1] = "e"
s[2] = "l"
s[3] = "l"
s[4] = "o"

c := make([]string, 5)

copy(c, s)

```

### <a name='map'></a> map

A map is combination of key value pairs. In other languages it's often called
dictionary.

```go
// creates an empty map of string - int key - value pairs
m := make(map[string]int)

// sets an the key "age" with the value of 29
m["age"] = 29

// deletes an element of a map
delete(m, "age")
```

### <a name='range'></a> range

To iterate over a map or a slice you can use **range**.

It returns two values: index and a copy of the element at that index.

The index or value can be skipped by using `_`

```go
numbers := []int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

for i, num := range numbers {
	fmt.Printf(i, num)
}
```

### <a name='method'></a> method

A method is a function with a special **receiver argument**.

```go
type Server struct {
	host          string
	port          string
}

function (s Server) printServer() {
	fmt.Printf(s)
}
```

See that we pass the Server as s as a **receiver** argument to the `printServer`
function before we the function name declaration?

Everything inside the function body has now **access** to the members of the
struct.

### <a name='pointers'></a> pointers

Pointers hold the **memory address** of a value.

```go
i := 42

// generate a pointer to i
p = &i

// read i through the pointer p
fmt.Prinln(*p)
```

### <a name='pointer-receivers'></a> pointer receivers

Methods can be declared with pointer receivers.

The differences between pointer receivers and value receivers are:

- pointer receivers can modify the value to which the receiver points
- with pointer receivers you can avoid copying the value on each method call
- sending the value of the variable to the function, but not the variable itself
- the value of the variable isnâ€™t passed to the function, just its location
- pointers are adresses to a particular place in memory

```go
type Server struct {
	host          string
	port          string
}

function (s *Server) printServer() {
	fmt.Printf(s)
}
```

Pointers and pointer receivers are little bit more **advanced topic** but it's
good to have heard of them as a beginner.

### <a name='interfaces'></a> interfaces

Interfaces are **named collections** of method signatures. To implement an
interface you just need to implement all methods in the interface.

```go
type interface {
	methodOne() int
	methodTwo() int
}

func methodOne() int {}

func methodTwo() int {}
```

### <a name='errors'></a> errors

A **nil** value in the error position indicates that there was no error.

```jsx
if err != nil {
	// log the error
}
```

Calling code should handle errors by **testing** whether the error equals nil.

And that is it, these are the **programming with go beginner topics** I came
across the last weeks and months while learning and working with go. I hope you
like it!
