## 👨🏻‍💻 Work

May was pieced with many public holidays, which meant working only three days a
week often. I know I could work on those public holidays because **I'm my own
boss**, but it felt great to take these breaks, and my wife didn't have to work
on these days anyway, so we took the opportunity.

I was part of a great and exciting project where we built a **collaboration
mode** for a website, and it was a lot of fun learning to work with
`web sockets`.

Besides that, I finally became part of the
[Prismic developer program](https://prismic.io/hire-a-developer), which feels
great. A lot of people reached out through that already.

## 📝 Blog Posts of the Month

Compared to the prior month, this month, **I wrote a lot**. I had more

## 🏡 Life

Sommer is here, and it's fantastic. We have a big terrace where we can enjoy
sunrises and sundowners. Compared to a year ago, were we still lived in the city
and our view was the neighbor's wall, this is such a significant upgrade for us,
and I feel that we made a lot of right choices.

Additionally, I'm having a lot of **fernweh**. Our first big holiday is at the
end of July, and I can't wait to get there. I'm so happy for all my friends who
are traveling right now and I can't stop to listen to there stories about it.
But I'm also looking forward to our holiday in July.

## 🏋🏻‍♀️ Fitness

I'm feeling good and strong lately. I follow a great mix of bodyweight fitness
to gain strength and endurance workouts. I started cycling again, and it felt so
much like total **freedom** to me. I just jump on my bike and ride. I often
notice afterward that that's when I almost **don't think**. I'm focused and in
the moment, and that feels fantastic.

## 📚 Reading

I read two books last month. The first one is:

- [Dark Matter - Blake Crouch](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27833670-dark-matter)

My first book by blake crouch was Recursion which I read last year. I started
dreaming about it, which shows me how much I was invested in the story. It made
me think a lot about the topics it's about, and it can break your head.

This one is similar. In the most basic terms, it's about the existence of
parallel universes, and reading a story about it makes you question so much that
it's complex and fascinating at the same time.

The second book was:

- [Das Leuchten der Rentiere - Ann Helen Laestadius](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61190509-das-leuchten-der-rentiere)

The book started too slow for me. I had a few times when I wanted to put it
away. I'm glad I didn't. The second half is brutal. Not an easy read if you love
animals.

## 🕹Video Games

It's Zelda - Tears of the Kingdom all over the place! I never finished Breath of
the Wild because, at the time, I was oversaturated with open-world games. But
now I'm having so much fun with it, and all the sounds trigger many
**nostalgic** feelings back from 2018. I love it!

That's it for the developer diaries in May 2023. See you next month!
