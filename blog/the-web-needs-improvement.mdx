Recently, I had a few experiences that shocked me. I wanted to accomplish some
small tasks on several websites. And I **struggled** with all of them. I can
confidently say I wasn't the problem, but the websites were. And the worst of it
was **no valuable error feedback for the user**!

Let's dive right into it. Here are the three tasks I wanted to accomplish:

- ☑️ Change my address on a payment platform
- ☑️ Change my invoice delivery method on a mobile provider's website
- ☑️ Change my Email address on a mobile provider's website

Let's start with the first one.

### Changing my address on websites

I had a little "housekeeping" to do a few days ago. The first thing I wanted to
do, was to change my address on a famous payment platform. So I headed to the
website, logged in, navigated to my profile, and added my new address details.
After clicking save, I got the feedback that the address had changed
successfully. But after heading back to my profile, it was still **the old
one**.

I tried it again a few times, even changing browsers and devices, but I also had
**no success there**. So finally, I was confused and annoyed and moved on to
something else.

### Don't send me receipts on paper, please

Next up on my list was that I wanted to change how I get my invoices from my
mobile provider. By default, they send them printed out to my mailbox, and I
don't need that. I'd be delighted to get them online in my account.

I tried to accomplish that by opening the native app. It even prompted me to
make this change, so I navigated to the menu item. It then opened an in-app
browser, tried logging me in on the mobile providers' website, and showed **an
endless spinner**. That's it. Great!

Of course, I tried again but couldn't get it to work. No user feedback at all
about what I can do differently or where the problem stems from. I ditched the
native app and did it on the website directly. I logged in and navigated to the
menu item. It navigated me to another page showing **an empty orange box**.
Awesome!

So far, two basic tasks on a website have been unsuccessful. But I had to do
another. I wanted to change my Email address on the website of my mobile
provider. Easy task, right? I navigated to my profile, headed to the section
where you can change your Email, and entered my new one. Guess what happened
after clicking on save? Yes, you're right. Nothing!

### The web is not accessible

I don't want to turn this blog post into a big rant. That's not my goal or
primary focus in writing about these experiences.

I also don't want to bash developers or product teams responsible for this.
**Bugs happen. Humans write harmful software all the time**.

But I'm still astonished that simple processes like this don't work. And they're
also not showing any helpful **user feedback** or **error messages**. And I can
imagine these are tasks that many users want to accomplish daily.

I'm a person with a technical background. I know I didn't do anything wrong, and
it's the website's fault that I can't accomplish my goal. But think about other
people who are not tech-savvy. They are just confused and angry and search for
the fault in themselves. That's bad.

It's disappointing that many websites out there are still in **bad condition**.
It's not everyones focus to make their website as accessible as possible. The
web is not accessible at all. And this needs to change.

There are still so many anti-patterns, from popups to cookie banner madness to
newsletter signups covering the whole page.

### AI will not come to the rescue

It's disappointing to know that a lot of websites are still bad. I'm sure the
workflows described above are not the most critical. But that does not make them
less relevant to users.

It's disappointing that in 2023, that these bad experiences even happen on pages
with **millions of customers**.

And I can confidently say that **AI will not help with these cases**. It's
awesome that something like ChatGPT exists. It can help with a lot of tasks
already. But it can't solve the problem that many websites are in bad shape.

On the other hand, I will not lose my job soon because there is still so much
work to do to make the web a better, more user-friendly, and more accessible
place.

### Helpful Error messages

Here are **two things you can do** right away if you have workflows on your
website that your users have problems with. First and most important: give your
users **valuable and actual error messages**. Just showing a yellow error box is
not helpful.

The Nielsen Normal group has a fantastic article about error message
guidelines: [Error Message Guidelines](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/error-messages/).

And second, have a channel open for your users to **communicate feedback and
report bugs**. Always keep communication available to your users. When I wanted
to talk to someone about this problem, I discovered I couldn't find a possible
way to communicate my findings in any manner. This was the most annoying thing
about it.

So if we look back at the beginning of this article, and recap the tasks, I
wanted to accomplish, it looks like this:

- ❌ Change my address on a payment platform
- ❌ Change my invoice delivery method on a mobile provider's website
- ❌ Change my Email address on a mobile provider's website

Our Job is to make the web better. And we need to do better.
