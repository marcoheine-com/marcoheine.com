Hello and welcome to the Developer Diaries 15! August is over already, but
summer is still going strong in Germany. August was a **great** month. It was
very hot, but I enjoyed it a lot!

## 👨🏻‍💻 Work

Last month, I built my first **online shop** with Shopify. I get it now why
Shopify is the GOAT of web shops. Their product is very good. Even without
coding skills, you can get your products to sell online in **under a few
hours**.

I used their React Framework `Hydrogen` based on Remix to build a headless
E-Commerce site. I learned a lot, and I documented the whole process in a blog
post. Make sure to check it out below.

Besides that, I worked on a website to **reduce the client-side JavaScript** to
improve the Page Speed Score on mobile. It’s great how many tools we as
developers get from the browser nowadays, like the
[code coverage](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/coverage/) from
Chrome

It’s a great help to figure out what JS is used and what’s just imported,
wasting space and recude download speed. On the website, `moment.js` was used to
format dates in a specific way. That reminded me of a previous job, where we
used `moment.js` heavily and already had the discussion around whether we needed
that or couldn’t native JS solve these tasks.

Thankfully, there’s
[this great article on GitHub](https://github.com/you-dont-need/You-Dont-Need-Momentjs)
where people made an in-depth comparison , and the conclusion is: yes, you don’t
need it!

By removing `moment.js` and using basic JS to format dates, I could reduce the
client-side JS by almost **50%** and make it much faster to load on mobile.

## 📝 Blog Posts of the Month

Here are the blog posts of August 2023:

- [Developer Diaries 14](/blog/developer-diaries-14)
- [How to build an E-Commerce website with Shopify Hydrogen V2 and Sanity](/blog/e-commerce-website-with-shopify-hydrogen)

I’m pretty happy about the e-commerce website write-up because it’s a **great
starting point** if you consider building your first headless online shop. I
documented all the steps I took to get up and going with the shop I recently
built.

## 🏋🏻‍♀️ Fitness

My current fitness routine is running two times a week, and doing my bodyweight
strength workout two times a week. I’m motivated to start my week with a 5k run,
and I’m curious how long it will stay that way.

I can imagine that I’ll go back to running once weekly as soon as the weather
changes to more autumn and rainy. I also would love to integrate cycling into my
fitness routine, but it doesn’t fit well right now. I’ll see if this changes
when I switch back to indoor cycling later this year.

## 📚 Reading

I finished three books this month. I got hooked on the Silo Series because it’s
running on Apple+. I managed to avoid trailers and spoilers and try to finish
the books until I start the TV series.

Project Hail Mary might be one of my **favorite books**. The story is just
wonderful. I’m really into science fiction right now, even though I thought that
I disliked that genre. But I think I especially like the books from this genre,
which start in a relatable environment and then enhance into more
science-fiction.

I added a few books from this section to my want-to-read list, and I hope they
are similarly beautiful. Anyway, here are the books from this month:

- [Wool: Book One of the Silo Series - Hugh Howley](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51852482-wool)
- [Winter of the World - The Century Trilogy #2 - Ken Follet](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12959233-winter-of-the-world)
- [Project Hail Mary - Andy Weir](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54493401-project-hail-mary)

## 🎙Podcasts

I listened to the [Syntax.fm](http://syntax.fm/) episode with Ryan Florence
recently. It’s a great talk about not only the framework Remix but also about
the web, web technologies, and the ways they’re evolving in general. I took a
lot of inspiration and further thinking from that.

## 🕹Video Games

I’m still big on Zelda. It still feels like I haven’t even finished half the
game. So much to see!

That's it for this month. See you in the next one!
