  This blog post summarizes my thoughts on Rich Harris talk about the current
  state of web development and his opinions on frameworks, the web and the edge.

If you watch one talk about the current state of web development, I recommend
the talk by
[Rich Harris: Frameworks, the Web, and the Edge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXCipjbcQfM).
It made me nod my head so many times I stopped counting.

It's so refreshing to listen to his humble opinions because they are
**detached** from the ever-ongoing discussions around the best technologies of
the web and focus more on a higher goal.

I wrote down my thoughts on some of his ideas to come back later to them every
now and then and **remind me why we are doing this**.

I want to state that I don't agree with everything Rich says in his talk.
However, I think that's pretty normal if you listen to someone's opinions.

### Your Framework is fine.

> The web doesn't suck because of JavaScript. The web sucks because of
> capitalism.

Rich points out that **websites aren't bad because of JavaScript** in this first
section of his talk. They are bad because of how data and algorithms have shaped
our society.

Recipe pages aren't clustered with Modals, Cookie Banners, or meaningless SEO
texts because of JavaScript. They are built like that because, sadly, that's
**how they make most of the money**.

> You shouldn't switch away from whatever makes you productive at shipping
> software.

These things also happen when you use any tech stack besides JavaScript because
they are detached from technology. So it doesn't make sense to jump on the wagon
every time a new framework comes up that claims to be a few milliseconds faster
and ships 10kb less JavaScript if you're intention stays the same: making the
most money, tracking your users, and neglecting user experience on purpose for
that case.

### 0kb of JS is not the goal

> The goal is to satisfy the user's needs, not to ship 0kb of JS.

We need to remind ourselves why we use the technology we use. The goal is not to
ship with 0kb of JS. The goal is to **give users what they want** in your
website or app.

If this means a lot of JavaScript is necessary to deliver the best user
experience, then that's how it is. A lighthouse score of 100 doesn't mean
anything if your users can't solve the task they want to accomplish.

### Most sites should work without JavaScript

> We need to ensure our tools keep working when unexpected things happen.

A thing we as developers do way too rarely is disabling JavaScript on a website
you've just built. So when I listened to Rich talk about this topic, I paused
and opened all the websites I recently built, disabled JavaScript, and tried to
move around them.

It's astonishing to me that this is not our highest priority. Progressive
Enhancements should be enforced way more, and the most crucial user needs should
be enabled to be accomplished without having to rely on JavaScript.

### MPAs are dead

Rich compares MPAs to SPAs here and explains why MPAs were on the rise, and SPAs
got a bad reputation.

Many of the reasons MPAs were better than SPAs (more accessible, faster, less
buggy, less JS) do not exist anymore because SPA frameworks like Next.js and
Svelte improved a lot and picked up.

The key argument against MPAs: **missing UI persistence**. MPA means when you
click a link, your browser does a full page reload.

UI persistence is only possible with client-side routing, which is only
available in SPAs. And UI persistence is a significant factor for a good user
experience.

### None of this matters

> I don't think AI will take our jobs soon, but I do think there's a
> better-than-even chance that it will change them beyond all recognition.

Rich points out that **the way we do our job will possibly change a lot in the
future due to the development of AI**. He's under the impression that it will
change in a way that code preferences will not play a role anymore in our
day-to-day job.

So we can have discussions and share ideas and inspiration around it, but in the
future, it might not be something we still need to consider.

I think that's an interesting point which I can support. It feels kind of
calming to me because it will mean we'll have the freedom to **focus on other
things but code preferences**.

And if you follow web development on social media, people love to discuss and
argue about code preferences. So if they can ditch that and focus on building
and shipping, it might be a good thing.
