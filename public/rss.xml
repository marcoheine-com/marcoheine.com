            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>CSS made a lot of progress in 2022. Many new features were added, and existing ones were improved and made more usable. Working with CSS these days is exciting, and I have found my love for it again.</p>
<p>To keep an overview of what&#x27;s new and what has changed, I will explain in detail in this blog post all you should know about the new CSS features in 2023.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> the features I talk about in this blog post are not new in CSS in 2023; they will gain major browser support soon or already have it recently. This means they are usable without thinking about polyfills, and that&#x27;s the real deal.</p>

<h2><a name="container-queries"></a> Container Queries</h2>
<p>Container Queries allow us to modify an element and its behavior not based on the viewport size but <strong>on the container it&#x27;s within.</strong></p>
<p>To use Container queries, you first have to define the container itself.</p>
<pre class="mb-12"><code class="hljs language-css"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">main</span> {
  container-type: inline-size;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Optionally you can also set the <code>container-type</code> and define a container name all at once.</p>
<pre class="mb-12"><code class="hljs language-css"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">main</span> {
  container: main / inline-size;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Next up, you have to write your container queries. This is possible by using several math operators. Using math operators in queries is also a great new addition!</p>
<p>The following query targets every paragraph inside our container with the name of main when the width of the container is greater or equal to 600px;</p>
<pre class="mb-12"><code class="hljs language-css"><span class="hljs-keyword">@container</span> main (<span class="hljs-attribute">width</span> &gt;= <span class="hljs-number">600px</span>) {
  <span class="hljs-selector-tag">p</span> {
    <span class="hljs-attribute">padding</span>: <span class="hljs-number">24px</span>;
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here&#x27;s another example on CodePen. If the container on the right is larger than 1200px, we make a grid out of the image and the text and position them next to each other.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://codepen.io/Mkuehb/pen/GRBxoZQ">https://codepen.io/Mkuehb/pen/GRBxoZQ <span> ↗</span></a></p>
<p>Why do we need container queries when most of the layout changes can be done by listening to the viewport width? The answer is <strong>context</strong>. Container Queries are such a perfect tool for components from whom we don&#x27;t know beforehand in which context they will be used.</p>
<p>So we can define the appearance of our component based on the <strong>container width</strong>, and it adapts. No matter if this component is used in a header, a sidebar, or a modal, for example.</p>
<p>Another addition to container queries is <strong>container query units</strong>. Container queries allow us to quickly implement responsive typography using container query units.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve already written about responsive typography using <a class="hover:border-b-2 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="/today-i-learned/clamp-css-function/">clamp()</a>.</p>
<p>This is typically done by listening to viewport widths. However, with the addition of container query units, we can replace this now by listening to the container&#x27;s width, height, inline size, block size, or the smaller or larger value of these.</p>
<p>Here&#x27;s the spec for all the new units: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://drafts.csswg.org/css-contain-3/#container-lengths">https://drafts.csswg.org/css-contain-3/#container-lengths <span> ↗</span></a>. It has yet to get full browser support, but container queries can be used in totally new ways if this lands.</p>
<h2><a name="focus-visible"></a> Focus-visible</h2>
<p>If you&#x27;ve been a web developer for a few years, chances are that your Project Manager or your Customers asked you to remove the &quot;ugly&quot; outlines around buttons when focused.</p>
<p>The following CSS achieves it:</p>
<pre class="mb-12"><code class="hljs language-css"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">button</span><span class="hljs-selector-pseudo">:focus</span> {
  <span class="hljs-attribute">outline</span>: none
}
</code></pre>
<p>Hint: <strong>Never do that!</strong> They are there for a reason: <a href="https://www.a11yproject.com/posts/never-remove-css-outlines/" target="_blanK" rel="noopener">https://www.a11yproject.com/posts/never-remove-css-outlines/ ↗</a></p>
<p>If you ever get asked that again, tell them there is now a better solution <code>:focus-visible</code>. This new <code>pseudo-class</code> tells the browser when to show focus rings based on heuristics.</p>
<p>This means it detects input modalities that require visible focus. So, for example, mouse users won&#x27;t see them on click, but keyboard users will have them on tab.</p>
<p>This is an excellent addition to CSS, as it removes them for mouse users, who won&#x27;t need it necessarily but keeps it for keyboard users, who heavily rely on it for accessibility reasons.</p>
<p>Try it out yourself:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://codepen.io/Mkuehb/pen/GRBxoZQ">https://codepen.io/Mkuehb/pen/GRBxoZQ <span> ↗</span></a></p>
<h2><a name="has"></a> :has()</h2>
<p><code>:has()</code> is a new selector that, as the name says, gets applied styles if the argument passed in matches at least one element. There are endless possibilities for how to use this new selector. It opens up a lot of new ways to select an element and apply styles to it <strong>conditionally</strong>.</p>
<p><code>:has()</code> is one of the four <strong>functional pseudo-classes</strong> along with <code>:is()</code>, <code>:where()</code>, and <code>:not()</code>, all of them can accept a selector list.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s best explained by showcasing a lot of examples, so here we go:</p>
<pre class="mb-12"><code class="hljs language-css"><span class="hljs-comment">/* selects the ul if it has a direct following li element */</span>
<span class="hljs-selector-tag">ul</span><span class="hljs-selector-pseudo">:has</span>(&gt;<span class="hljs-selector-tag">li</span>) {
  <span class="hljs-attribute">margin-left</span>: <span class="hljs-number">1rem</span>;
}

<span class="hljs-comment">/* selects the a element if it has a direct following img element */</span>
<span class="hljs-selector-tag">a</span><span class="hljs-selector-pseudo">:has</span>(&gt;<span class="hljs-selector-tag">img</span>) {
  <span class="hljs-attribute">border</span>: <span class="hljs-number">1px</span> solid yellow
}

<span class="hljs-comment">/* selects the last li element if the ul element has li elements */</span>
<span class="hljs-selector-tag">ul</span><span class="hljs-selector-pseudo">:has</span>(<span class="hljs-selector-tag">li</span>) <span class="hljs-selector-tag">li</span><span class="hljs-selector-pseudo">:last-child</span> {
  <span class="hljs-attribute">margin-bottom</span>: <span class="hljs-number">0</span>;
}
</code></pre>
<p><code>:has()</code> can also be combined with the other pseudo-classes. And it enables us to do logical operators like <code>AND</code> and <code>OR</code>.</p>
<pre class="mb-12"><code class="hljs language-css"><span class="hljs-comment">/*
  Selects the ul if it has a li element which has a direct a as a child
  AND if it has a li which has a span as a direct child
*/</span>
<span class="hljs-selector-tag">ul</span><span class="hljs-selector-pseudo">:has</span>(<span class="hljs-selector-tag">li</span> &gt; <span class="hljs-selector-tag">a</span>)<span class="hljs-selector-pseudo">:has</span>(<span class="hljs-selector-tag">li</span> &gt; <span class="hljs-selector-tag">span</span>) {
  <span class="hljs-attribute">color</span>: lightblue;
}

<span class="hljs-comment">/*
  Selects the ul if it has a li element which has a direct a as a child
  OR if it has a li which has a span as a direct child
*/</span>
<span class="hljs-selector-tag">ul</span><span class="hljs-selector-pseudo">:has</span>(<span class="hljs-selector-tag">li</span> &gt; <span class="hljs-selector-tag">a</span>, <span class="hljs-selector-tag">li</span> &gt; <span class="hljs-selector-tag">span</span>) {
  <span class="hljs-attribute">color</span>: lightblue;
}

<span class="hljs-comment">/* Selects the section if it hasn&#x27;t a direct child of h1, which has an h2 and a p as adjacent siblings */</span>
<span class="hljs-selector-tag">section</span><span class="hljs-selector-pseudo">:not</span>(<span class="hljs-selector-pseudo">:has</span>(&gt; <span class="hljs-selector-tag">h1</span> + <span class="hljs-selector-tag">h2</span> + <span class="hljs-selector-tag">p</span>)) {
  <span class="hljs-attribute">font-family</span>: Times-New-Roman;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Yes, you could say that <code>:has()</code> is a <strong>parent selector</strong>. You can match an ancestor element based on containing a specific descendant. But that&#x27;s not all!</p>
<p>You can also target ascendant elements if the condition returns true on the initial selector. I&#x27;ve already shown that in the first example, but here are some more:</p>
<pre class="mb-12"><code class="hljs language-css"><span class="hljs-comment">/*
  Selects the p if the main has an h1 as a direct child, which is followed by an h2
  AND if the main has an h2 as a direct child who is followed by an h3
  AND if the main has an h3 as a direct child, which is followed by an h4
*/</span>
<span class="hljs-selector-tag">main</span><span class="hljs-selector-pseudo">:has</span>( &gt; <span class="hljs-selector-tag">h1</span> + <span class="hljs-selector-tag">h2</span>, &gt; <span class="hljs-selector-tag">h2</span> + <span class="hljs-selector-tag">h3</span>, &gt; <span class="hljs-selector-tag">h3</span> + <span class="hljs-selector-tag">h4</span>) <span class="hljs-selector-tag">p</span> {
  <span class="hljs-attribute">font-size</span>: <span class="hljs-number">2rem</span>;
}

<span class="hljs-comment">/* Selects the label inside a p element if the p contains a form control
that is required but not currently valid. */</span>
<span class="hljs-selector-tag">p</span><span class="hljs-selector-pseudo">:has</span>(<span class="hljs-selector-pseudo">:required</span><span class="hljs-selector-pseudo">:invalid</span>) <span class="hljs-selector-tag">label</span> {
  <span class="hljs-attribute">color</span>: red;
}

<span class="hljs-comment">/* Selects the label inside any element if the element contains a form control
that is required but not currently valid. */</span>
* <span class="hljs-selector-pseudo">:has</span>( &gt; <span class="hljs-selector-tag">label</span> + <span class="hljs-selector-pseudo">:required</span><span class="hljs-selector-pseudo">:invalid</span>) &gt; <span class="hljs-selector-tag">label</span> {
  <span class="hljs-attribute">color</span>: red;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The examples above are from <a href="https://12daysofweb.dev/2022/css-has-selector/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the fantastic blog post by Estelle Weyl ↗</a> and perfectly showcase the <strong>usefulness</strong> of the <code>:has()</code> selector.</p>
<p>This means <code>:has()</code> is not solemnly a parent selector. It&#x27;s a <strong>relational selector</strong>! As I said at the beginning, this new functional pseudo-class brings endless possibilities. It&#x27;s awesome. I&#x27;m under the impression that I haven&#x27;t even started to grasp the scope of what&#x27;s possible now.</p>
<h2><a name="subgrid"></a> Subgrid</h2>
<p>Before <code>subgrid</code> existed, a grid inside another grid couldn&#x27;t be aligned along the tracks of the parent grid. Here&#x27;s a <strong>CodePen</strong> with a grid inside another grid:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://codepen.io/Mkuehb/pen/GRBxoZQ">https://codepen.io/Mkuehb/pen/GRBxoZQ <span> ↗</span></a></p>
<p>Now with subgrid, you can tell the inner grid with <code>grid-template-columns: subgrid</code> that the columns should be aligned with the ones of the parent.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://codepen.io/Mkuehb/pen/GRBxoZQ">https://codepen.io/Mkuehb/pen/GRBxoZQ <span> ↗</span></a></p>
<p>Subgrids can be used without limitation downwards, so you can <strong>nest</strong> them endlessly as long as the parent has the grid property. This opens up many possibilities for defining grids; it&#x27;s a beautiful addition!</p>
<h2><a name="accent-color"></a> Accent-Color</h2>
<p>Styling form elements or adding the most minimalistic CSS changes were always a <strong>pain</strong>. You likely needed external libraries or packages to achieve that.</p>
<p>This changed recently with the introduction of <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/accent-color" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accent-color ↗</a>.</p>
<p>It allows you to set the <code>accent-color</code> of user-interface controls.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s currently usable on <code>input type= &quot;checkbox&quot;</code>, <code>input type= &quot;radio&quot;</code>, <code>input type=&quot;range&quot;</code>, and <code>&lt;progress&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Here&#x27;s a <strong>CodePen</strong> to showcase its usage of it:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://codepen.io/Mkuehb/pen/GRBxoZQ">https://codepen.io/Mkuehb/pen/GRBxoZQ <span> ↗</span></a></p>
<h2><a name="individual-transform-properties"></a> Individual Transform Properties</h2>
<p>The <code>transform</code> property was one of my favorite additions to CSS back when it was introduced. I love to use it to create little animations and transitions.</p>
<p>It lets you define one or more transform functions at once. Here&#x27;s an example:</p>
<pre class="mb-12"><code class="hljs language-css"><span class="hljs-selector-class">.caption</span><span class="hljs-selector-pseudo">:hover</span> {
  <span class="hljs-attribute">transform</span>: <span class="hljs-built_in">rotate</span>(<span class="hljs-number">10deg</span>), <span class="hljs-built_in">scale</span>(<span class="hljs-number">1.2</span>), <span class="hljs-built_in">translateX</span>(-<span class="hljs-number">20px</span>);
}
</code></pre>
<p>What happens here is that on <code>hover</code>, our DOM element with the class of <code>.caption</code> will rotate by 10 degrees clockwise, will scale up to 1.2 of its size, and will move 20px horizontally to the left.</p>
<section class="my-10 flex flex-col bg-[#edf6ff] px-10 pt-5 pb-2 md:ml-6"><h3>Hi Friend!</h3><p>If you enjoy my writings and learn something from them, you can consider to <strong>support me</strong>! One way of doing this is just as easy as <strong>buying me a Coffee!</strong></p><p>Thanks so much! This means a lot to me and is a great way to <strong>support my work</strong>.</p><a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/marcoheine" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="mb-4 inline-block self-center rounded-md bg-[#79d6b5] p-2 font-bold text-black hover:text-white"><span role="img" aria-label="coffee emoji">☕️</span> Buy me a coffee <span role="img" aria-label="coffee emoji">☕️</span> </a></section>
<p>There&#x27;s one <strong>problem</strong> with it. If you want to change just one of the transform properties later on, like in a media or container query, you must write the <strong>whole definition</strong> again for all properties.</p>
<pre class="mb-12"><code class="hljs language-css"><span class="hljs-keyword">@media</span> (<span class="hljs-attribute">min-width</span>: <span class="hljs-number">1200px</span>) {
  <span class="hljs-selector-class">.caption</span><span class="hljs-selector-pseudo">:hover</span> {
    <span class="hljs-attribute">transform</span>: <span class="hljs-built_in">rotate</span>(<span class="hljs-number">10deg</span>), <span class="hljs-built_in">scale</span>(<span class="hljs-number">1.8</span>), <span class="hljs-built_in">translateX</span>(-<span class="hljs-number">20px</span>);
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>We&#x27;ve just applied one change on the scale property but had to write it for all of them again. If we wouldn&#x27;t, they would reset to the default.</p>
<p>But this is a thing of the past now! Introducing: <strong>individual transform properties</strong>.</p>
<p><code>scale()</code>, <code>translate()</code>, and <code>rotate()</code> can now be used individually without having to define them inside a transform declaration. Very cool!</p>
<p>Here&#x27;s our example from above with individual transform properties:</p>
<pre class="mb-12"><code class="hljs language-css"><span class="hljs-selector-class">.caption</span><span class="hljs-selector-pseudo">:hover</span> {
  rotate(<span class="hljs-number">10deg</span>);
  scale(<span class="hljs-number">1.2</span>);
  translateX(-<span class="hljs-number">20px</span>);
}

<span class="hljs-keyword">@media</span> (<span class="hljs-attribute">min-width</span>: <span class="hljs-number">1200px</span>) {
  <span class="hljs-selector-class">.caption</span><span class="hljs-selector-pseudo">:hover</span> {
    scale(<span class="hljs-number">1.8</span>);
  }
}
</code></pre>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In a recent project, I used TypeScript Type Guards so much that I wanted to write a blog post about them with great examples and why I like them. They&#x27;ve helped me prevent errors and make my code safer and more reliable.</p>

<h2>What are TypeScript Type Guards <a name="what-are-typescript-type-guards"></a></h2>
<p>TypeScript Type Guards are used when you only want to allow a specific type in a function, for example. The need for something like this derives from the fact that only this particular type has the values you can work with further.</p>
<p>If you&#x27;d use a function that&#x27;s manipulating data in some sort on a type that would be <strong>missing</strong> these values, you will run into <strong>errors</strong>.</p>
<p>So TypeScript Type Guards are one of the first and best ways to ensure you only process further in your programming logic with relevant data.</p>
<h2>How to write a great Type Guard <a name="how-to-write-a-great-type-guard"></a></h2>
<p>Let&#x27;s learn more about Type Guards by looking at an example. To create one, you have to write a function whose return type is a <strong>type predicate</strong>. The predicate has the form: <code>parameterName is Type</code>.</p>
<p>Imagine you are getting some data from an API of your headless CMS. In your CMS, users can set the fields of a link element there. The link element would translate into a TypeScript Interface which would look like this:</p>
<pre class="mb-12"><code class="hljs language-typescript"><span class="hljs-keyword">interface</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">FilledLink</span> {
	<span class="hljs-attr">url</span>: <span class="hljs-built_in">string</span>
	<span class="hljs-attr">isExternal</span>: <span class="hljs-built_in">boolean</span>
	<span class="hljs-attr">isTargetBlank</span>: <span class="hljs-built_in">boolean</span>
}
</code></pre>
<p>But they can also leave it empty and not add it in. This would look something like that:</p>
<pre class="mb-12"><code class="hljs language-typescript"><span class="hljs-keyword">interface</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">EmptyLink</span> {
	<span class="hljs-attr">url</span>: <span class="hljs-literal">undefined</span>
}
</code></pre>
<p>When we consume this data via API, we want to ensure we only work with it if it&#x27;s a filled link and not <code>null</code>. So we only want to go further when it has the type of <code>FilledLink</code>.</p>
<p>Otherwise, if we didn&#x27;t care and would render a link field in React, we would run into errors. We would access the URL field, which can be <code>undefined</code>, and our user interface would break.</p>
<p>So here&#x27;s what a Type Guard for this scenario would look like:</p>
<pre class="mb-12"><code class="hljs language-tsx"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> isFilledLink = (<span class="hljs-attr">link</span>: <span class="hljs-title class_">EmptyLink</span> | <span class="hljs-title class_">FilledLink</span>): link is <span class="hljs-title class_">FilledLink</span> =&gt; {
	<span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> link?.<span class="hljs-property">url</span> !== <span class="hljs-literal">undefined</span>
}
</code></pre>
<p>Let&#x27;s have a closer look on what happens here. We define a function who takes in a parameter of type <code>EmptyLink | FilledLink</code>. The return type is a type predicate, which is a function that returns a boolean. The boolean is used to determine if the type is <code>FilledLink</code> or not.</p>
<p>This ensures, that we can work on with the url field, because we know it&#x27;s not <code>undefined</code> anymore.</p>
<p>This is called a <strong>custom Type Guard</strong> or a <strong>user-defined Type Guard</strong>. It&#x27;s the most powerful because you can customize it all the way you want.</p>
<h2>Built-in Type Guards <a name="built-in-type-guards"></a></h2>
<p>There are also built-in Type Guards in TypeScript. The following exist:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html#typeof-type-guards" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> typeof ↗</a>
</li>

<li>
<a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/narrowing.html#equality-narrowing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">equality narrowing ↗</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I&#x27;ve linked them all to the official TypeScript documentation, so you can read more about them there.
I will write a detailled blog post about these soon, so stay tuned!</p>
<p>That&#x27;s it about TypeScript Type Guards, in this case specifically about user-defined or custom Type Guards!</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Number 8 of my developer diaries series is about a chaotic month with the release of one of the biggest projects, context-switching and illness]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Initially, I wanted to skip this version of the developer diary for December 2022. Unfortunately, it was a chaotic month with much context-switching, illness, and just pushing through until the year ended.</p>
<p>But then I thought it’s still interesting to reflect on a month like this, so here we are for Developer Diaries 08, the December 2022 edition!</p>
<h2>👨🏻‍💻 Work</h2>
<p>Work-wise, the month started well structured. I knew I wanted to do a little less this month, so I didn’t start any new projects. Instead, I worked 2-3 days a week for an agency from Stuttgart, where I helped with bug fixes and improving several features.</p>
<p>Besides that, we planned on finishing the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://aerosolalliance.com/">Aerosol Alliance Website <span> ↗</span></a>, which I already talked about in the last episode of the Developer Diary. We made a lot of progress on this case over the previous weeks. We implemented many changes that made the site look more coherent.</p>
<p>As I already mentioned a few times, it’s a cooperation with my friends from <a href="https://studiovierkant.de/" target="_blank">Studio Vierkant ↗</a>. It’s so much fun to work with them on this together. We meet up in their office for a few hours or a day, and we work next to each other and quickly ship many improvements.</p>
<p>I’m hoping for new opportunities in 2023 to start new projects together!</p>
<p>Work-wise in December, the biggest thing that happened was the finish and release of the new website for the <a href="https://www.stuttgarter-kickers.de/" target="_blank">Stuttgarter Kickers ↗</a>, the second-biggest soccer club from Stuttgart.</p>
<p>Initially, my Friend Tobi from Werk8 asked me to help with a few things. In the end, I did most of the Backend and CMS development, and he did most of the Front-end development.</p>
<p>I love how the new website turned out. It’s super fast and a significant improvement. Was a lot of fun to work on that project.</p>
<h2>📝 Blog Posts of the month</h2>
<p>I made some progress on some blog posts, which lay deep down in my backlog for a while, but I didn’t finish one. On the one hand, this means not a lot of released posts in December 2022; on the other, it means I can kick-start 2023 with many cool new blog posts.</p>
<p>Here’s the only blog post from December 2022:</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="hover:border-b-2 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="/blog/developer-diaries-07/">Web Developer Diary 07</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>🎓 TIL Posts of the month</h2>
<p>Here are the Today-I-learned posts for December 2022:</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="hover:border-b-2 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="/today-i-learned/clamp-css-function/">Clamp CSS Function</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>🏋🏻‍♀️ Fitness</h2>
<p>The month started normally; I did my almost daily Yoga/workout session in the morning and felt good and healthy. Then I got sick like nearly everyone. I haven’t been this sick since Covid in June. Thankfully it wasn’t Covid again, but nevertheless, it was one week of being totally knocked out.</p>
<p>Here are my apple watch rings from December 2022</p>
<p><img src="/images/apple-watch-rings-december-2022.webp" alt="Apple Watch Rings December 2022"/></p>
<h2>📚 Reading</h2>
<p>I never thought this would happen, but I didn’t finish a single book this month. It’s mainly because I started one of the biggest ones I’ve ever read. It’s the first part of the Century Trilogy by Ken Follett, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7315573-fall-of-giants" target="_blank">Fall of Giants ↗</a>.</p>
<p>I’ve almost finished it, and I can’t wait to read parts two and three, although I know they also have more than 900 pages.</p>
<h2>🕹 Video Games</h2>
<p>We started playing the new Pokemon games on the switch, and we’re not too happy with them. Of course, playing Pokemon is always fun, but I didn’t get too engaged in it. Despite the terrible and unfinished look and the ton of bugs, which I can ignore, it doesn’t really feel motivated to me to explore on catch more Pokemon.</p>
<p>So I made a spontaneous decision and bought a totally new game. It’s Xenoblade Chronicles 3; I always saw my friend Dom playing it. So far I have enjoyed it a lot!</p>
<p>That’s it for the Developer Diary 08 in December 2022. See you next month!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Number 7 of my web developer diary series is about able to choose with whom I work and great teamwork]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>November was a great month, I liked it a lot. It was about remembering my <a class="hover:border-b-2 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="/about/#values">values</a>, being able to choose with whom I work and great teamwork.</p>
<h2>👨🏻‍💻 Work</h2>
<p>This month I once again noticed that it&#x27;s incredible that I can work with people who share the same <strong>work</strong> <strong>habits</strong> and <strong>principles</strong> as me. They deny a lot that doesn&#x27;t fit into these values we have in common.</p>
<p>I can say no to work that contradicts my work ethic, which is a huge privilege, and I&#x27;m more than <strong>grateful</strong> for that.</p>
<p>In November, I was on the edge of finalizing a great project with my friend Tobi. It will be released in December, and I&#x27;m pleased about the outcome. Working together with Tobi is the most fun and motivational. We have a great workflow and are both experts in our field, which is a powerful combination.</p>
<p>We already have fantastic projects planned for the next year, and I can&#x27;t wait to get started on them. If you also want to start a project and need two great guys who&#x27;re able to help you with that, <a href="https://www.werk8.design/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">check out the website of our collective. ↗</a></p>
<p>Besides that, I worked on the aerosol alliance website for the first time since the summer. We did a silent go-live a few months ago and are slowly sending people to it. It&#x27;s a great project for a great cause, and I&#x27;m thrilled I can help these guys.</p>
<h2>📝Blog Posts of the month</h2>
<p>I dedicated less time to writing this month. On the one hand, I missed it, and on the other hand, it felt good to use this time for other stuff. I&#x27;m not sure how to deal with it next month. We&#x27;ll see. Here are the blog posts for November 2022:</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="hover:border-b-2 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="/blog/whats-new-in-nextjs-13/">What&#x27;s new in Next.js 13</a></li>

</ul>
<h2>🏋🏻‍♀️ Fitness</h2>
<p>I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m saying this, but: I started running again! I quit it over ten years ago because my knees always hurt. I&#x27;m willing to give it another chance now. I started slow to protect my knees, but it felt amazing running on the beach in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Besides that, I&#x27;m doing a mix of yoga and bodyweight fitness almost every morning, which feels like the perfect combination.</p>
<p>Here are my apple watch rings from November 2022</p>
<p><img src="/images/apple-watch-rings-november-2022.webp" alt="image of apple watch rings of november 2022"/></p>
<h2>📚 Reading</h2>
<p>I only finished one book this month; I wasn&#x27;t so motivated to read. I&#x27;m not sure if the book I read was the reason or that I was often too tired to read.</p>
<p>The book I finished was something special. It includes highly controversial and horrible topics and is not your usual read. Nevertheless, it has an interesting story. I&#x27;m not sure what to make of it yet.</p>
<ul>
<li>

</li>
</ul>
<h2>🕹Video Games</h2>
<p>In November, the new Pokemon games for the Nintendo Switch were released, which I anticipated very much. So we bought both editions, Violet and Scarlet, so my wife and I could play simultaneously.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m not sure if I like it so far; it has a lot of bugs and looks not too good. But in the end, it&#x27;s Pokemon, which I love.</p>
<h2>🎙Podcasts</h2>
<p>I did listen to podcasts, but nothing tech related. I don&#x27;t know what to do with this category; my motivation to listen to developer podcasts is insignificant.</p>
<h2>🔔 A special note</h2>
<p>You may have noticed the name change! I was never too sure about the title &quot;web developer diary.&quot; However, I like the new one more and want to try it out. Let&#x27;s see where this lead.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s it for November 2022. See you next month!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At the end of October, Next.js released a new big update - <strong>Next.js 13</strong>. This
blog post will look into all the new features and discuss the changes and
improvements.</p>
<hr class="my-10"/>
<p>Table of Contents</p>
<ul>
<li>Experimental features (in alpha and beta)
<ul>
<li>app directory</li>
<li>turbo pack</li>
<li>next/font</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Stable features:
<ul>
<li>next/image</li>
<li>improved next/link</li>
<li>OG Image Generation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Conclusion</li>
</ul>
<hr class="my-10"/>
<p>The new big and shiny update is divided into two main
categories: <strong>experimental</strong> <strong>features</strong>, released as alpha and beta and not
recommended for production usage, and <strong>stable</strong> <strong>features</strong>.</p>
<h2>Experimental features (alpha/beta)</h2>
<p>Let&#x27;s start with the features you should wait to adapt for your production app,
but they will be available soon.</p>
<h3>New app directory(beta)</h3>
<p>With Next.js 13, the new <strong>app</strong> directory is introduced. This is a
significant <strong>mental mode change</strong> in how we build websites with Next.js in the
future. The main idea behind this new approach is to <strong>separate</strong> the views that
don&#x27;t need data to render and make them available as quickly as possible to the
user. In addition, a loading state for the views that need to fetch data will be
available for that part of the page.</p>
<p>This is possible thanks to <strong>React Server Components</strong>. The app directory will
enable us to define <strong>layouts</strong> that are able to share state across navigations.
These UIs are sharable between pages, and they prevent expensive re-renders.</p>
<p>Before Next.js, we used the <strong>pages</strong> directory. Inside a page, we fetched data
and passed it down to components who displayed it. With the app directory, each
component itself can get the data it needs individually. This is a massive
change, and it will likely lead to significant performance improvements with
less JavaScript sent to the client.</p>
<h3>Turbopack(alpha)</h3>
<p>Next.js 13 includes a brand new <strong>bundler</strong>: Turbopack. The Next.js team states
that it is <strong>700x faster than Webpack</strong>. Rust-powered tooling seems to be the
fastest these days. What an improvement.</p>
<p>With an application of around 3000 modules, Turbopack takes <strong>1.8s</strong> to bundle
everything. This incredible speed comes from the fact that it only bundles the
minimum assets required in development. In addition, it has out-of-the-box
support for Server Components, TypeScript, JSX, CSS, and more.</p>
<p>Remember that it&#x27;s still in alpha, and many changes will happen. But still, what
a fantastic job.</p>
<h3>next/font/beta)</h3>
<p>Next.js 13 contains a <strong>brand new font system</strong>, which makes privacy a
first-class citizen. With this new font system, all the CSS and font files are
downloaded at build-time and self-hosted, along with the other static assets.</p>
<p>This means you can use all the google fonts without having one request to google
in your network tab. This is amazing.</p>
<p>The new font system also significantly improves performance by supporting
caching and preloading for google fonts and custom fonts. Layout shifts will
also be a thing of the past by using the font-display CSS property.</p>
<h2>Stable features</h2>
<p>Now let&#x27;s look at the new features you can use <strong>right away</strong> when upgrading to
Next.js 13 stable.</p>
<h3>next/image</h3>
<p>The new next/image component brings a lot of benefits. The one I like the most
is that <strong>alt tags are now required</strong>, forcing users to apply more care for
accessibility.</p>
<p>The new syntax will look like this:</p>
<pre class="mb-12"><code class="hljs language-jsx"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Image</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> <span class="hljs-string">&#x27;next/image&#x27;</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> profilePicture <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> <span class="hljs-string">&#x27;/images/profile-picture.webp&#x27;</span>

<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">ProfilePage</span> = (<span class="hljs-params"></span>) =&gt; {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> (
    <span class="xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">Image</span>
      <span class="hljs-attr">alt</span>=<span class="hljs-string">&quot;profile picture of Marco&quot;</span>
      <span class="hljs-attr">src</span>=<span class="hljs-string">{profilePicutre}</span>
      <span class="hljs-attr">placeholder</span>=<span class="hljs-string">&quot;blur&quot;</span>
    /&gt;</span></span>
  )
}
</code></pre>
<p>The new image component will also ship less client-side JavaScript and be faster
because the native lazy-loading doesn&#x27;t require hydration. Overall, it&#x27;s a
significant improvement where the Next.js team did a fantastic job in making the
image component more accessible and faster.</p>
<p>The Next.js team provided a <strong>codemon</strong> to make upgrading to the new next/image
component easy.</p>
<pre class="mb-12"><code class="hljs language-bash">npx @next/codemod next-image-to-legacy-image ./pages
</code></pre>
<h3>improved next/link</h3>
<p>The Next.js team also made some improvements on the next/link component. The
component won&#x27;t require an extra <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> tag anymore. Yay! With Next.js 13, every
Link component will automatically render an a tag inside. It&#x27;s such a small
thing, but it will improve the developer experience; I like it.</p>
<h3>OG Image Generation</h3>
<p>The Next.js Team created a new library to automatically generate <strong>social
cards</strong>, also known as open graph images. The motivation was to offer an easy
way to create <strong>dynamic</strong> social cards. By using Vercel edge functions, it&#x27;s
super fast and easy to use. I&#x27;m going to try that out soon.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Next.js October release brought a lot of minor but helpful improvements and
significant changes which will alter major things in Next.js. I&#x27;m excited about
its future and can&#x27;t wait to build a new project with the app directory
approach.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[Number 6 of my web developer diary series is about working coming back to germany, feeling healthy and new opportunities.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/web-developer-diary-6.webp" alt="an open notebook"/></p>
<p>October was a mix of everything. From jumping out of summer straight into cold
and dark weather in Germany, seeking new opportunities, car problems, and
investing more time into learning again.</p>
<h2>Work</h2>
<p>In the first two weeks of October, we were still on workation in the south of
France. This was a fantastic experience. I wrote a whole blog post about it, and
I can’t wait to do it again.</p>
<p>At the end of October, one of my favorite work projects <strong>ended</strong>. It wasn’t a
big surprise that it ended. It wasn’t a bad ending. Initially, I needed to help
with the project because one of the leading developers wasn’t available for
three weeks. So we planned that I should help out during August.</p>
<p>That turned into me working on this project for three months. It was a lot of
fun working with awesome people. I learned a lot, and it was not the last time
working together. They left me with such <a class="hover:border-b-2 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="/#testimonials">fantastic feedback</a>.
It puts such a big smile on my face whenever I read it.</p>
<p><strong>New Opportunities</strong> came up, and with my friend Tobi from</p>
<a href="https://www.werk8.design/" target="_blank" rel="nooper noreferrer"><p>Werk8 ↗</p></a>
<p>, we already planned projects for next year, possibly one of our biggest ones. Exciting
times!</p>
<p>One of my key learnings as a freelancer is that it’s always a constant struggle
between having less work and not too much work. I have no clear vision of how to
handle this long-term, but I think that’s a thing you’ll learn with more
experience.</p>
<h2>Blog posts of the month</h2>
<p>October was my best month for blogging. I published a blog post every week,
which felt amazing, and I’m proud of it. <strong>Scheduling</strong> the first 25 minutes of
my day for writing was a <strong>game-changer</strong>. This feels like the perfect time for
me to write.</p>
<p>Here are the blog posts for October:</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="hover:border-b-2 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="/blog/workation/">Workation</a></li>

</ul>
<h2>TIL posts of the month</h2>
<p>I’m trying to establish Wednesday as my today-I-learned day. Here are the
today-I-learned posts of October:</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="hover:border-b-2 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="/today-i-learned/secure-javascript-url-validation/">Secure JavaScript URL validation</a></li>

</ul>
<h2>Everything else than web dev</h2>
<h3>🏋🏻‍♀️ Fitness</h3>
<p>I felt terrific during October, health, and Fitness wise. During our workation,
we started every day by doing yoga or a short workout on our balcony. It was
almost too good to be true because the sun would rise during our training, and
we were greeted every day by this view.</p>
<p><img src="/images/sunrise-ollioules.webp" alt="image of the sunrise over the town Ollioules"/></p>
<p>As you can see below in my apple rings, I could close them almost daily. And the
funny thing is, you can exactly spot when we traveled back from France.</p>
<p><img src="/images/apple-watch-rings-october-2022.webp" alt="image of apple watch rings of october 2022"/></p>
<h3>📚 reading</h3>
<p>Holidays and time spent not at home meant a lot of time for reading. I managed
to finish three books.</p>

<p>Covid changed the world and showed companies that <strong>remote work</strong> is possible
and a valuable alternative to working from an office full-time. In addition,
many employees appreciated the fact of <strong>not having to commute</strong> and being able
to spend more time with their <strong>families</strong>.</p>
<p>We, as software developers, are one of the very privileged groups who can work
from anywhere in the world. We need a laptop and a decent internet connection.
We are not bound to a physical place.</p>
<p>This possibility of being able to work from anywhere, combined with the fact of
being a freelance web developer, freed me completely. Most of my clients work
remotely as well. I&#x27;ve never had to go into a client&#x27;s office.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ve always wanted to try the concept of <strong>workation</strong>. But working at my desk,
taking a break, stepping outside in the sun, and looking at the beach seemed
like a ridiculous dream. But, with Covid enabling more remote work and me being
a freelancer, deciding for myself where to work, workation seemed possible!</p>

<h2>What is a workation <a name="what-is-a-workation"></a></h2>
<p>If you&#x27;ve never heard of workation, it combines <strong>work and vacation.</strong> You go
wherever you want to go in the world for a holiday. You enjoy it, and you relax.
And then you stay a little longer and also work from there.</p>
<p>In September 2022, my wife and I took this opportunity and wanted to try it out.
My wife works as a UX designer, and her company enabled her to work from
anywhere in Europe for up to a few months a year, which is fantastic.</p>
<p>Our chosen place for our workation was the <strong>south of France</strong>, and we aimed for
an eternity of <strong>4 weeks</strong> to test it out. If it worked and we liked it, we
wanted to do it as often as possible during the year.</p>
<h2>How to prepare for your workation <a name="how-to-prepare-for-your-workation"></a></h2>
<p>If you plan to do a workation as well, here are a few things I recommend to
check and plan. When we started looking for a place we wanted to go to, checking
these things helped us to decide and feel comfortable that this workation would
work well for us.</p>
<h3>Having a decent place to work <a name="having-a-decent-place-to-work"></a></h3>
<p>For us, this was the most crucial thing to get right. A small hotel room might
be perfect if you&#x27;re going on holiday. Most of the time, you use it to sleep
there and spend the rest of the time outside, at the pool, or on trips.</p>
<p>But if you also plan to spend more time there and mainly work from there, your
accommodation needs completely different characteristics. We were looking for at
least a separate dining table with few chairs where you can work.</p>
<p>Because let&#x27;s be honest here. Lying on a beach, working at the bar, or sitting
in the sun seems great in theory. Maybe it&#x27;s incredible for a few days. But for
any time longer, you want to have a decent place to work. At least for us,
that&#x27;s the way we felt about this.</p>
<p>Airbnb has this new option where hosts can mark their space as a good workplace.</p>
<p><img src="/images/airbnb-dedicated-workspace.png" alt="image of Airbnb option"/></p>
<p>It could be clearer what the exact criteria are to mark your place as such.
Airbnb tries to clear this up in</p>
<a href="https://www.airbnb.com/resources/hosting-homes/a/how-to-make-your-space-comfortable-for-remote-workers-236" target="_blank"><p>this article ↗</p></a>
<p>.</p>
<p>The accommodation we chose was marked as a place like this. The pictures showed
a separate table and a chair which you were able to work on. This made our
choice easier because we could imagine how it would be to work from there.</p>
<p>Next to the location itself should offer, there are also some things you can
arrange to have the best place to work outside your typical office. For us, this
meant bringing some <strong>extra gear</strong>. I got a <strong>laptop stand</strong> and a <strong>Bluetooth
mouse</strong> and <strong>keyboard</strong> to prevent staring down at my laptop for four weeks and
hurting my neck.</p>
<p><img src="/images/workation-2.webp" alt="image of work setup"/></p>
<p>This was a great idea so we could have at least some kind of <strong>ergonomic
environment</strong>.</p>
<h3>Internet connection <a name="internet-connection"></a></h3>
<p>Checking that the place you want to spend your workation has a good internet
connection is mandatory. So that&#x27;s one of the first things we did when we looked
for accommodation on Airbnb.</p>
<p>The internet connection should be good enough to enable two people
simultaneously to have video calls with the camera turned on.</p>
<p>If you&#x27;re looking at Airbnb, many hosts share screenshots of <strong>their internet
connection speed tests</strong>. This is super helpful. It&#x27;s easy to write down any
connection speed in your Airbnb ad, but having some proof is very reassuring.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s advisable to bring an <strong>ethernet cable</strong> as well. Often times the wifi is
okay, but if it varies too often, using the plugged-in connection is much more
reliable and faster.</p>
<p>An excellent <strong>mobile plan</strong> with some extra data as a backup can be a lifesaver
on that.</p>
<p>We were lucky on this. When we found an apartment that met our requirements, the
host had already added a screenshot of the up-and-download, which had high
numbers. Other people mentioned in the <strong>reviews</strong> that they also had worked
from there, which was perfect.</p>
<h3>Safety first <a name="safety-first"></a></h3>
<p>Another thing we wanted to make sure was covered on our workation was safety.
Safety for us meant we should feel comfortable working there because we wouldn&#x27;t
need to worry about working with <strong>sensitive data</strong> or our tech and devices.</p>
<p>If you&#x27;re working outside your home or your company office, where these safety
standards are applied, you&#x27;ll also want to add an extra safety layer.</p>
<p>For us, this meant several things. First, using free wifi, which is still pretty
standard in hotels, is not a good idea. If you can, always
use <strong>password-protected wifi connections.</strong> Using a VPN is also always a great
idea. Finally, encrypting your hard drive is a must-have.</p>
<section class="my-10 flex flex-col bg-[#edf6ff] px-10 pt-5 pb-2 md:ml-6"><h3>Hi Friend!</h3><p>If you enjoy my writings and learn something from them, you can consider to <strong>support me</strong>! One way of doing this is just as easy as <strong>buying me a Coffee!</strong></p><p>Thanks so much! This means a lot to me and is a great way to <strong>support my work</strong>.</p><a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/marcoheine" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="mb-4 inline-block self-center rounded-md bg-[#79d6b5] p-2 font-bold text-black hover:text-white"><span role="img" aria-label="coffee emoji">☕️</span> Buy me a coffee <span role="img" aria-label="coffee emoji">☕️</span> </a></section>
<p>Suppose you decide to work outside of your accommodation, like in a cafe, bar,
or restaurant where other people can directly see your screen and what you are
working on, it&#x27;s advisable to apply a <strong>screen protector</strong> on your laptop
screen. This enables only you can see what&#x27;s going on on your screen.</p>
<p>So these are the things we applied to ensure we could work in a safe
environment. There is a lot more you can do, so if you have any ideas on this
topic, let me know!</p>
<h2>How it went and why you should go too <a name="how-it-went-and-why-you-should-go-too"></a></h2>
<p>This headline spoils it already a bit. After spending four weeks in the south of
France and working from there for 2,5 weeks, I can say <strong>it went great</strong>!
Everything we worried about did not happen. Overall it was a fantastic
experience, and I recommend it.</p>
<p>Of course, it takes some time to get used to a new work environment. Especially
not having a big external monitor. But after a day or two, this wasn&#x27;t a
problem.</p>
<p>The wifi at our place was good enough so that my wife and I could have calls
with our cameras turned on without sounding like robots.</p>
<p>But there is clearly one best thing to it. It&#x27;s a fantastic feeling to have a
typical workday and close your laptop and <strong>go to the beach</strong> afterward. Or
another beautiful place. Go for a hike. Or even already during the workday.
Sometimes I got so focused on a work problem that when I took a break and
stepped outside onto the terrace, I was so surprised and amazed to live in this
beautiful place with this fantastic few.</p>
<p>Additionally, it&#x27;s incredible to have more time to explore another country,
city, or place. Usually, if you&#x27;re staying somewhere for a few days on holiday,
you need more time to see everything. So you have to choose. But this is hard
because you have this urge to want to try everything. After all, time is tight.</p>
<p>If you also plan to work from there, you can relax. You&#x27;ll have plenty of time.
You can enjoy everything at a slower pace because you&#x27;ll stay there longer.</p>
<p>After our first workation, after four weeks of being on holiday and working from
there, it was a great success. We loved it. And we are already planning for more
workations.</p>
<p>Have you already done a workation? Or do you plan to do one? Let me know about
it, I&#x27;m super curious! Just write me an</p>

<p><img src="/images/benjamin-dada-EDZTb2SQ6j0-unsplash.webp" alt="A person sitting on a desk searching on google on their MacBook"/></p>
<p>The optimization of websites for search engines has always been a mystery to me.
There seemed to be so many factors that get used to calculate how a page gets
ranked on a search engine like google. I even learned how page ranks get
calculated during my master&#x27;s degree.</p>
<p>Still, it was always a bit hard for me to understand what to optimize for,
concerning keywords and content.</p>
<p>One thing though where SEO is very clear to me is from a technical point of
view. I know that Google ranks websites better that are fast, accessible, and in
great shape technology-wise.</p>
<p>Thanks to different tools and my knowledge as a web developer I know what a
website needs to have to succeed in this area. Still, I neglected that for too
long on my website.</p>
<p>Problems and mistakes I would never have on client websites popped up on my site
and I needed to fix them. Here are all the SEO mistakes I had on my website and
how I fixed them, so you can avoid these pitfalls.</p>

</ul>
<hr class="my-10"/>
<h2>Multiple h1 <a name="multiple-h1"></a></h2>
<p>I’ll start with the easiest one. I had several h1 on my pages! I don’t know how
that happened, I guess I didn’t control it at all. Having a hierarchy ofƒ
headings is crucial and I’m a little embarrassed that this happened on my site.</p>
<h3>How I fixed it:</h3>
<p>I used different tools to check the order of my headings on all pages and fixed
them. I learned that having correct headings is not that more of a factor in
getting ranked in search engines. Still, it is mandatory to make your
website <strong>accessible</strong>. People who use a <strong>screen reader</strong> are <strong>dependent</strong> on
a correct heading order to grasp the content of your website. Wave is a great
tool to improve on that.</p>
<h2>Trailing slashes <a name="trailing-slashes"></a></h2>
<p>My site is built with Gatsby and deployed and hosted with Netlify. Netlify has
this option to <strong>pretty print</strong> URLs, which adds trailing slashes to every link.</p>
<p>But I did not add them everywhere in my code in Gatsby. This resulted in a lot
of <strong>301 redirects</strong> where links without trailing slashes were redirected to
them with it. That’s unnecessary and bad for SEO.</p>
<h3>How I fixed it:</h3>
<p>There were <strong>two ways</strong> to fix this problem. The first one would have been
to <strong>disable</strong> the option in Netlify. This would have removed all the extra
added trailing slashes. But it would have also left me with a great mixture of
URLs with trailing slashes and without.</p>
<p>Since the majority of my URLs have them and Google also indexed them with
trailing slashes, I chose the second option to fix this problem. This meant
adding trailing slashes to every link I set in my code. It was a bit tedious but
necessary and now I try to be consistent with it.</p>
<h2>Canonical links <a name="canonical-links"></a></h2>
<p>I did not set up canonical links at all on my site which is a big mistake. I
often try to spread my blog posts on different platforms besides my website,
like <a href="https://dev.to/mkuehb/react-performance-quick-wins-7-easy-ways-to-improve-your-react-performance-part-2-4j3c" target="_blank">dev.to
↗</a> and medium, to reach more people.</p>
<p>Not having set up correct canonical tags is a problem. If search engines look at
pages with the same content, they can&#x27;t find out which of the resources is the
original one. This means my website could get a <strong>penalty</strong> for
distributing <strong>duplicate content</strong>, although it’s my content!</p>
<h3>How I fixed it:</h3>
<p>I set up canonical links on my website and double-checked them on every page. I
used the plugin
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-react-helmet-canonical-urls/">gatsby-plugin-react-helmet-canonical-urls <span> ↗</span></a>
to do that. It’s a great plugin that makes it easy to set up canonical links.</p>
<h2>Canonical points to redirect <a name="canonical-points-to-redirect"></a></h2>
<p>I had a lot of canonical links that pointed to 301 redirects. This is a
combination of the two problems I explained before. I had URLs that
were <strong>upperCase</strong> in my code, like this
one /today-i-learned/performance-and-useMemo/</p>
<p>Once again the Netlify URL pretty print kicks in and tells the browser hey the
actual URL is /today-i-learned/performance-and-usememo, so it’s not the same and
we need a redirect! Oh no.</p>
<p>The problem here is, that the canonical URL stays the same (with upperCase) and
that’s bad for SEO because we get another unnecessary redirect.</p>
<h3>How I fixed it:</h3>
<p>I made sure that all my URLs are lowercase. It’s a bit hard to get Netlify to
acknowledge these changes so I had to delete the upperCase file, remove it from
git and re-add it later with the lowercase URL.</p>
<h2>404 - broken links <a name="broken-links"></a></h2>
<p>I’ve you’re blogging for some years, you may link to websites that don’t exist
anymore, changed the URL, part of the URL, etc. I’ve had a lot of these issues.</p>
<h3>How I fixed it:</h3>
<p>It used a tool to analyze all blog post links and then updated or removed them.
I thought about writing a <strong>CronJob</strong> which clicks on all the links on a newly
published blog post. But in the end, it was not worth the effort.</p>
<h2>Missing meta tags (and other stuff in the head) <a name="missing-meta-tags"></a></h2>
<p>The most important meta tags for me always were the <strong>media-query</strong> one,
the <strong>utf-8</strong>, and the <strong>description</strong>.</p>
<p>Of course, I knew that there were way more but I didn’t know which made a huge
difference for SEO. For example, I didn’t set the open graph tags and Twitter
card tags at all on my site.</p>
<h3>How I fixed it:</h3>
<p>Once again I used a tool to analyze the head of my site and set all meta tags in
my SEO component in Gatsby.</p>
<h2>Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a></h2>
<p>There are a lot of easy mistakes one can make, without even knowing about them.
Take your time to inspect your website in the <strong>dev tools</strong>, check out the head
tag, check if all meta tags are there, and set them to the correct values.</p>
<p>Use different tools to check your website. There are a lot of them out there.
I’ll write a separate blog post soon on what kind of tools I recommend and use.</p>
<p>Fixing <strong>a11y mistakes</strong> also means SEO. First, we should optimize our websites
to the best for our users. Doing the best we can to make
them <strong>accessible</strong> and <strong>fast</strong>. Google recognizes if we succeeded in doing so
and rewards us with a better page rank.</p>

<p>At the start of this year, my life changed completely. At the end of January,
<strong>I quit my job</strong> as a software developer at a wonderful software service
company. Starting February the first I became a <strong>freelance web developer</strong>.</p>
<p>It has been almost half a year now since that big change happened. But this blog
post won’t be about my new carrier choice. I’m already planning a separate blog
post on my life and learnings as a freelance web developer, so stay tuned!</p>

<p>This blog post will be about everything I learned in this last job as a
permanently employed software developer. I think it’s a great moment to <strong>step
back and reflect</strong> on the last two years. Think about everything I learned,
liked and I miss.</p>
<h3><a name="the-beginning"></a> The Beginning: a great team is everything</h3>
<p>I started working at this company in June 2020 as a front-end developer. I
specifically applied for the Frontend Developer React position. I was
immediately excited that I could keep my <strong>React focus</strong>, which I established in
my previous jobs.</p>
<p>Fun fact: I wrote a blog post for the sole purpose to get this job. It’s the one
about <a class="hover:border-b-2 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="/blog/two-good-reasons-to-use-react/">two things I like about react</a>.
Someone later told me, that having a blog and writing about React was a great
plus when I applied and started at the company.</p>
<p>So keep on blogging people! It can get you jobs, which is pretty cool!</p>
<p>When I started there, I joined a team of 4 other developers. Right from the
start we had a great team spirit, working together was a lot of fun and I
learned so much. I couldn’t wish for better colleagues.</p>
<p>Together with several UX designers and product owners, we developed a B2B
web-based application. I started with smaller front-end tasks, working with
React. Pretty soon I also started working with the backend part of our
application. This meant working with NodeJS and MongoDB.</p>
<p>My view on software development <strong>expanded</strong> as I got the possibility to work on
all ends of an application for the first time. Again I learned so much and I
also think I could expand my skills quickly.</p>
<p>I think I’ve never used <code>Object.keys</code> and <code>Object.entries</code> so much before as at
that time. Besides developing all these new coding skills, I also learned more
about the <strong>SCRUM process</strong>.</p>
<p>This applies especially to sprint reviews. I think we nailed them all the time
because we put special effort into preparing them. We aimed to show our work to
the clients in the best way possible.</p>
<h3><a name="the-middle"></a> The Middle: skyrocketing my developer knowledge</h3>
<p>After a few months of working in this team on that particular project, a big
change presented itself. I got asked to change projects to support a new and
small one where I would build the front-end of an MVP.</p>
<p>This was a wonderful opportunity because it meant my work there was valued and
they trusted in me and my skills. On the other hand, I got to leave this awesome
team and didn’t have the opportunity to work with them that close anymore.</p>
<p>I did some thinking and then agreed to the change. In the beginning, the deal
was that I would be working there for a few weeks, at most one or two months on
this MVP. Spoiler: I stayed there for more than a year.</p>
<p>After the MVP was done, the project became pretty successful and important. The
team grew and I once more got the chance to work as a <strong>full-stack developer</strong>.
This time it meant learning Golang and working with PostgreSQL.</p>
<p>It’s really funny to see how I started working exclusively at the front-end and
in the end, I worked on everything. <strong>From styling changes with CSS to writing
raw SQL database queries</strong>. It was a lot of fun and I learned so much.</p>
<p>Once more, besides learning new coding skills, there were a lot of different
fields to learn and grow in.</p>
<p>Like learning how to understand clients&#x27; and users&#x27; needs. And most important:
to <strong>challenge the wishes of our clients</strong>. This is one of the most crucial
things I learned there.</p>
<h3><a name="the-end"></a> The End: reasons to leave and lessons learned</h3>
<p>After working for more than one and a half years for this company, I developed a
desire to work on <strong>different kinds of projects</strong>. I also wanted to gain more
<strong>freedom over my time</strong> again.</p>
<p>As our project team grew bigger, we had more topics to discuss and of course
more meetings. This also meant less time for productive coding and less time to
think deeply about problems. I don’t think this is a bad thing, it’s natural if
a team grows.</p>
<p>But that’s just not what I wanted anymore, so I decided it was time for a
change. A big one in this case for me. I figured that just changing companies
wouldn’t do it for me. I wanted to try out something completely different.</p>
<p>Someone who guided me through this phase always told me, if something is off,
<strong>change it, leave it or accept it</strong>. I think that this is such a great and
simple advice, something I will never forget and often refer to.</p>
<p>I’ve always thought about freelancing one day. But I figured I needed to gain
more experience first. Like working on different projects and learning from
different people. But at this point, it felt like I could do it. And so I went
for it.</p>
<section class="my-10 flex flex-col bg-[#edf6ff] px-10 pt-5 pb-2 md:ml-6"><h3>Hi Friend!</h3><p>If you enjoy my writings and learn something from them, you can consider to <strong>support me</strong>! One way of doing this is just as easy as <strong>buying me a Coffee!</strong></p><p>Thanks so much! This means a lot to me and is a great way to <strong>support my work</strong>.</p><a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/marcoheine" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="mb-4 inline-block self-center rounded-md bg-[#79d6b5] p-2 font-bold text-black hover:text-white"><span role="img" aria-label="coffee emoji">☕️</span> Buy me a coffee <span role="img" aria-label="coffee emoji">☕️</span> </a></section>
<h3><a name="at-the-horizon"></a> At the horizon</h3>
<p>Almost two years of working as a software developer at this company have taught
me a lot. And it was a wonderful experience. I had the opportunity to work on
important projects. I could participate in delivering great solutions to make
our clients happy and help them to achieve their goals.</p>
<p>I had the best teammates you can imagine and the culture of teaching and
learning was well-established. It was natural to speak up when you didn’t know
something.</p>
<p>Compared to my working situation now I sometimes miss working in a team with so
talented and smart people.</p>
<p>I also loved to pair-program and develop great solutions to complex problems
together. Which does not happen that often anymore when you freelance.</p>
<p>What I don’t miss is the number of meetings or doing stand-ups every morning.
One of the best things this change has brought me is that I can plan my day and
my week according to what I want to work on.</p>
<p>So after all, my last job as an employed software developer had a lot of ups and
also some downs. It was a memorable adventure and I wouldn’t want to miss it.</p>
<p>But in the end, I’m happy with the decision I made. I’m looking forward to
everything I’m gonna learn on this new path as a freelance developer!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[Number 5 of my web developer diary series is about working from anywhere in the world (still mostly europe) in september 2022, holidays and reading a lot.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/web-developer-diary-5.webp" alt="an open notebook"/></p>
<p>Welcome to Web Developer Diary #05! Another month is over which means I’m gonna
reflect on everything that happened in September 2022! Sometimes I’m brave
enough to try out new things. And I’m feeling so kind of right now. So here’s
the new thing. Try out to describe this month with just one word. And that word
would be: <strong>Fun</strong>!</p>
<p>September was packed. We went to two weddings and danced until our feet hurt. We
went to see Ed Sheeran in the Olympic stadium in Munich. And we drove 1000km to
the south of France with our 20 years old Volvo called Carla.</p>
<h2>Work</h2>
<p>This month we were using our huge privilege to be able to work from anywhere in
the world. At least where the internet connection is good enough to enable two
people have video calls at the same time. Without sounding like robots. An where
the timezone kind of matches with the people we are working with.</p>
<p>This month I worked out of a hotel room in a small town where our friends got
married. I worked in a beautiful co-working space in the WunderLocke hotel in
Munich. And I worked in our Airbnb in the south of France on the kitchen table
or the terrace while looking at the Mediterranean sea.</p>
<p>We went here for 4 weeks in total, doing 2 weeks of vacation and 2 weeks of
working from here. We always wanted to try out this thing called <strong>Workation</strong>.
I’m not gonna spoil too much right now because I’m planning to write a fully
detailed blog post on this topic soon.</p>
<p>But what I can say so far: It’s awesome. I imagined it way more stressful when
working not from you’re usual workplace, without a big screen and the fastest
internet connection possible. But with a little preparation and the correct
tools, it works!</p>
<h2>Blog posts of the month</h2>
<p>I wasn’t in the mood of writing a lot in September, so it’s just these two blog
posts:</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="hover:border-b-2 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="/blog/web-developer-diary-04/">Web developer diary 04</a></li>
<li><a class="hover:border-b-2 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="/blog/typescript-tooling-in-prismic/">TypeScript Tooling in Prismic</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Nevertheless, I’m very happy especially about the TypeScript Tooling post,
because writing about it made me realize again how much it improves my developer
life.</p>
<p>It’s this time of the year again when I’m thinking about writing a blog post a
week although already knowing that I can’t manage it. We’ll see how this turns
out.</p>
<h2>TIL posts of the month</h2>
<p>Here are the Today-I-learned posts of the month:</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="hover:border-b-2 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="/today-i-learned/the-a11y-project/">The a11y project</a></li>
<li><a class="hover:border-b-2 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="/today-i-learned/web-vitals-element/">web-vitals-element</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Everything else than web dev</h2>
<h3>🏋🏻‍♀️Fitness</h3>
<p>I got a new tattoo which meant 2 weeks of not working out at all. After that I
also got sick (not covid thankfully) so another week of not working out.
Surprisingly it doesn&#x27;t show too much in my apple watch rings. I wonder if I
should be happy about this or worried because I moved a lot although not feeling
that good.</p>
<p><img src="/images/apple-watch-rings-september-2022.webp" alt="screenshot of my apple watch rings of september 2022"/></p>
<p>After taking enough time to recover, I did a lot of light walks and hikes. I
also starting to work out again slowly. Currently, I do it every morning after
my morning coffee while watching the sunrise. It&#x27;s incredible.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m trying to convince myself to move every morning in October. We’ll see how
that turns out.</p>
<h3>📚Reading</h3>
<p>Being on holiday means having even more time to read books and I love it! Here
are the books I read in September:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12497.No_Country_for_Old_Men" target="_blank"><p>No country for old men - Cormac MacCarthy ↗</p></a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/206236.The_Power_of_the_Dog" target="_blank"><p>The Power of the dog - Don Winslow ↗</p></a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23602561-the-cartel" target="_blank"><p>The Cartel - Don Winslow ↗</p></a>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>🕹Video Games</h3>
<p>I did not play any video games at all, as we are not at home where my Xbox is. I
took my switch with me but did not want to play with it so far.</p>
<p>I’ve never told this but I started playing Pokemon Go when it came out in 2016
and never stopped since then. So that’s what keeps me busy on this topic!</p>
<h3>🎙Podcasts</h3>
<p>I didn’t listen to any tech-related podcasts at all this month. I wasn’t really
in the mood for it. I blame the holidays and me not opening my MacBook once for
two weeks.</p>
<p>That’s it for the recap of September 2022. See you next month!</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>I researched a lot about Content Management Systems, before starting my
freelance web developer career. I tried a few, disliked some and got stuck with
Prismic. The mental model of shaping websites with custom types and slices just
clicked for me.</p>
<p>So far, Prismic offers everything I need from a headless CMS. A great user
experience for authors, a lot of flexibility for developers and a great
community where asking for help is easy.</p>

<h2><a name="my-problems-with-prismic"></a>My problems with Prismic</h2>
<p>There is one thing I’ve missed though and that made my work harder. It was to
<strong>manually create TypeScript Types and Interfaces</strong> for my Prismic Custom Types
and Slices.</p>
<p>My usual workflow with Prismic goes like this. Figure out which pages and what
kind of repeatable elements we need and turn that into Custom Types and Slices.</p>
<p>After that I head into my Next.js app and query for the data. The next hours are
spent setting up Types and Interfaces for the Custom Types and Slices.</p>
<h2><a name="typescript-is-a-no-brainer"></a>TypeScript is a no-brainer</h2>
<p>Working with TypeScript is one of the things I learned on my last job as an
employed software developer. It is something I would <strong>never like to miss
anymore</strong>.</p>
<p>This blog post won’t be about why you definitely need to use TypeScript. But I
like to highlight a few points that make working with TypeScript in Prismic a
lot of fun to me and <strong>improve my workflow</strong>.</p>
<p>It makes me faster because my code-editor tells me what kind of fields I have on
a specific element and which fields I don’t have. It’s that simple. I think
that’s always been the main selling point to me.</p>
<p>My code knows what’s there and what’s not. What exists and what does not so a
mispelling of a key in a JavaScript object won’t cause the UI to break. This
prevents bug and improves the developer workflow.</p>
<p>So setting up Types and Interfaces for my Prismic Custom Slices and Types was a
lot of work but necessary. I would query for the data, look at the Prismic API
response and write the Types.</p>
<p>At some point I had built my own types folder which I could reuse on projects or
use it as a starting point. It still was a lot of repetitive work.</p>
<h2><a name="improved-typescript-tooling"></a>Improved TypeScript tooling</h2>
<p>But guess what: this is now work of the past! Prismic recently released a lot of
awesome features around TypeScript tooling! There are two big improvements.
<strong>Prismic ts codegen</strong> and <strong>automatic types in Prismic Client</strong>.</p>
<h3><a name="prismic-ts-codegen"></a>Prismic ts codegen</h3>
<p>Prismic ts codegen is a <strong>new cli tool</strong> that generates types for Custom Types
and Slices. So everything I’ve done manually on my last projects will be taken
care of. Awesome!</p>
<p>It’s super easy to use and I encourage everyone to implement it in future (or
even current) Prismic projects. First you have to install the package:</p>
<pre class="mb-12"><code class="hljs language-bash">npm install --save-dev prismic-ts-codegen @prismicio/types
</code></pre>
<p>Next you have to create a config file in your root folder:</p>
<pre class="mb-12"><code class="hljs language-bash">npx prismic-ts-codegen init
</code></pre>
<p>Finally you have to tell it where to find your models for whom types should be
created. If you use the Slicemachine and thus have them in your local project
folder it already should be filled in.</p>
<p>Now you are all set up! If you run <code>npx prismic-ts-codegen</code> Types for all your
Slices and Custom Types get created in a single file. And if you need to update
them, just run the command again. It’s so helpful and such a great thing to
have. My prismic developer workflow improved a lot since using it!</p>
<h3><a name="prismic-client-automatic-types"></a>Prismic Client automatic types</h3>
<p>The Prismic Client was also updated to use these automatic types created by
prismic-ts-codegen. This makes working with Prismic and TypeScript a love-love
realationship.</p>
<p>You automatically generate your Types and they are used throughout your app
without needing to do anything. That’s awesome.</p>
<p>When I started working with it, I quickly discovered a case were I thought that
I still would have to do some additional work to run everything smoothly. I’m
talking about typing content relationships. Because querying for linked
documents is not automatically typed in Prismic. But Prismic also got us covered
here. In the
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://prismic.io/docs/technical-reference/prismicio-client#typing-content-relationships">docs <span> ↗</span></a>
they share exactly how to solve this case. Great!</p>
<h2><a name="conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Working with TypeScript in Prismic just got so much better with the release of
this huge improvement for TypeScript tooling. As I already said many times
before, this improves my workflow a lot and I’m so glad about it!</p>
<p>I’m curious what Prismic has planned for future releases and I’m happpy by
choosing it as my main CMS.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/web-developer-diary-4.webp" alt="an open notebook"/></p>
<p>New Month, new web developer diary entry! This time it’s the fourth and I’m
writing about everything that happened in august!</p>
<h2>Work</h2>
<p>I remember from the post last month that I described july as rather slow and
quiet. This month was quite the opposite. Lot of new projects, new opportunities
and new things coming together. The groundwork I put it in the previous months
absolutely paid off.</p>
<p>It’s super interesting to see the effects of networking in action.</p>
<p>This reminds me of a pretty common saying: “never burn bridges”. It’s always
great to keep communication open to people you’ve previously engaged with. Who
knows what’s gonna happen in the future.</p>
<p>I also never thought that something like a simple twitter direct message could
lead to a great time working on a cool project.</p>
<p>So august: busy month, working for different clients, on different projects. But
still fun. I learned a lot of new things and this freelance journey is still an
exciting ride.</p>
<h2>Blog posts of the month</h2>
<p>No other blog post published than the previous version of this series
unfortunately.</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="hover:border-b-2 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="/blog/web-developer-diary-03/">Web developer diary #3</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Some great posts are almost done but need this half an hour additional
fine-tuning before I’m happy with them.</p>
<p>Couldn’t find the time for that but this means I’ll publish more posts in
september! Besides that, one of my recent posts,
<a class="hover:border-b-2 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="/blog/just-hit-publish/">just hit publish</a> got featured by two amazing people I
follow for a long time already.</p>
<p>Jeremy featured it in his <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://adactio.com/links?start=20">link collection <span> ↗</span></a>
and Stefan introduced it in his newsletter
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://www.stefanjudis.com/blog/web-weekly-74/">web weekly #74 <span> ↗</span></a> . That made me
really happy. It’s awesome to hear that someone liked your writing.</p>
<h2>TIL posts of the month</h2>
<p>As I already said in the beginning of this pos, I learned some cool stuff this
month and documented it as today-I-learned posts. The theme setting without js
is probably my favorite one. And I&#x27;ve already integrated the checklist of the
a11y project into my developing workflow.</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="hover:border-b-2 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="/today-i-learned/faster-page-loads-with-early-hints/">Faster page loads with early hints</a></li>

<li><a class="hover:border-b-2 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="/today-i-learned/incomplete-list-of-css-mistakes/">Incomplete list of CSS mistakes</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Everything else than web dev</h2>
<h3>🏋🏻‍♀️ Fitness &amp; health</h3>
<p>I moved a lot this month and could close my rings almost everyday! It&#x27;s always
cool to see that I were this active. Gives me a lot of confirmation why I feel
better.</p>
<p><img src="/images/apple-watch-rings-august-2022.webp" alt="screenshot of my apple watch rings of august 2022"/></p>
<p>I pushed my workout time to the morning again. But not right out of bed as it’s
been like for most of my twenties. My new workout time is right after my morning
coffee, so I’m a little more awake and energized and I’m happy with it. This and
a very cold shower are my favorit way to start into a new day.</p>
<p>I did not write my bike a lot as I wasn’t in the mood that often this month. I
miss it but it wasn&#x27;t a priority. We&#x27;re travelling a lot the next weeks, so
we&#x27;ll see when the next time on the bike will be.</p>
<h3>📚 Reading</h3>
<p>I’m in a reading flow and have a lot of fun reading books. I’m still behind my
reading challenge of reading 30 books this year, but who cares. 2 books a month
is also a lot for me and I notice that more and more situations occure where I
grab a book instead of my phone. And that’s all I ever wanted.</p>
<p>This month I’ve read:</p>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57558287-city-on-fire">City on fire - Don Winslow <span> ↗</span></a></li>
<li>[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18143977-all-the-light-we-cannot-see](All
the light we cannot see - Anthony Doerr)</li>
<li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42046112-recursion">Recursion - Blake Crouch <span> ↗</span></a></li>
</ul>
<p>All three of them are great books I can recommand. I think I’m getting better in
choosing books I might enjoy. Especially the last one made my mind go crazy. I
won&#x27;t spoil anything but the genre is science-fiction and the main topics are
parallel-universes. I dreamed almost every night about it. What a book.</p>
<h3>🕹 Video Games</h3>
<p>I’m dreading the ending of Elden Ring. I’m still in front of the final boss and
haven’t touched it since. Instead I switched to Dark Souls 1 on my switch and
it’s a lot of fun. I’m curious when I’ll find the courage to actually finish
Elden Ring. Or if I’m going to complete Dark Souls 1 first.</p>
<h3>🎙 Podcasts</h3>
<p>I’ve listened to an episode of darknet diares where</p>
<a href="https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/121/" target="_blank"><p>Ed Skoudis shares super interesting stories from his job as a penetration
tester ↗</p></a>
<p>. Some of them are absolutely insane and I couldn’t believe them at first. Web Security
is such a fascinating topic.</p>
<p>That’s it for <strong>august 2022</strong> in the web developer diary series. See you next
month!</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/web-developer-diary-3.webp" alt="an open notebook"/></p>
<p>It’s August already which means recapping everything that happened in July! July
was a different month. A lot of heat in southern germany. With almost no AC’s
here we are not that used to it.</p>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/fAv2n4Tlhshig/giphy.gif" alt="a gif of a dog sweating"/></p>
<h2>Work</h2>
<p>Work wise this month started quiet. The month before was already quiet because
of our wedding, our little honeymoon and of course my covid infection. This
meant for july: getting back into the game. I did a lot of what you may call
marketing? But I’m not sure if it’s the right term.</p>
<p>I produced a lot of content for my own website. Wrote blog posts, wrote
today-I-learned posts. Re-organized some stuff on it, added some
<a class="hover:border-b-2 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="/work/#projects">recent projects</a> so people can see what I worked on so far.</p>
<p>Besides that I tried to get into SEO for real for the first time. And man, you
can get into some deep rabbit holes in this topic. I tried out the

and totally recommend it. I learned a lot about SEO and tools I could
immediately use to improve my website and blog.</p>
<p>Also I’m pretty happy that I discovered the
<a href="https://ahrefs.com/webmaster-tools" target="_blank">ahref webmaster
tools ↗</a>. It’s a massive collection of SEO tools. It can crawl your
website and show you errors like broken links, broken redirects, 404&#x27;s. I’m
planning to write a whole blog post on easy SEO fixes because I learned so much
when using this tool.</p>
<p>Additionally we almost finished a project for a good cause. It’s the website for
the <a href="https://aerosolalliance.com" target="_blank">Aerosol Alliance
↗</a>. It has the goal to reduce the emissions of spray cans. My friends
from <a href="https://studiovierkant.de/" target="_blank">Studio Vierkant
↗</a> work in the spray paint industry and they’re collaborating with
manufacturers on this topic. It’s really exciting!</p>
<h2>Blog posts of the month</h2>
<p>July was one of the best months for me, concerning writing. I managed to publish
3 blog posts. And I’m very happy with everyone of them. I had a lot of fun
writing them. Here are the blog posts of the month:</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="hover:border-b-2 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="/blog/web-developer-diary-02/">Web developer diary #2</a></li>

<li><a class="hover:border-b-2 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="/blog/just-hit-publish/">Just hit publish</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>TIL posts of the month</h2>
<p>The Today-I-learned collection grew aswell! It’s getting bigger and bigger every
month. It feels so cool to have this big selection of things I learned,
documented so well for the future me. Here are the Today-I-learned posts of
july:</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="hover:border-b-2 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="/today-i-learned/data-fetching-in-react-18/">Data fetching in react 18</a></li>

</ul>
<h2>Everything else than web dev</h2>
<p>Talking about everything else then web dev, I really liked this month. I had
some time to pursue some private projects. I loved getting back into working out
and reading a lot.</p>
<h3>🏋🏻‍♀️ Fitness &amp; health</h3>
<p>With my covid infection last month, I needed to take some time in the beginning
of the month for recovery. I didn’t wanted to take any risk. After some time I
started again with small and light almost daily workouts. And I felt really
good! I think that&#x27;s also visible in my rings:</p>
<p><img src="/images/apple-watch-rings-july-2022.webp" alt="screenshot of my apple watch rings of july 2022"/>
I noticed how I got stronger again. I played a lot with my rings and I almost
forgot how much fun they are!</p>
<h3>📚 Reading</h3>
<p>This was my best month concerning my reading challenge. I know it’s not about
the amount of books I read, but I took a lot of time to read which makes me
happy. I read some great books and can recommend all of them. My favorite one
was where the crawdads sing by Delia Owens. I could feel how I get drawn into
this world. And that is clear a sign of a fantastic book.</p>
<p>Here are the books I read in july:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50993.East_of_the_Mountains" target="_blank"> <p>East of the mountains - David Guterson ↗</p></a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40404801-notes-on-a-nervous-planet" target="_blank"><p>Notes on a nervous planet - Matt Haig ↗</p></a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36809135-where-the-crawdads-sing" target="_blank"> <p>Where the crawdads sing - Delia Owens ↗</p></a>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>🕹 Video Games</h3>
<p>I picked up Mario Odyssey again, which I haven’t finished, although I bought it
3 years ago. But the day will come where I’m gonna collect all the moons. Also I
got pretty excited when I noticed that fall guys was released on the switch.
It’s just so much fun.</p>
<p>After a longer break I also got back into Elden Ring. And man, this game is
still so good. I’m somewhat over 100h in and Level 138. I feel like I’m getting
closer to the end and I just don’t want it to finish. I hope there will be a DLC
soon. I tried out a new build and I’m having a blast.</p>
<h3>🎙 Podcasts</h3>
<p>I picked up two episodes of <a href="http://Syntax.fm" target="_blank">Syntax.fm
↗</a> which made me really interested to dig deeper. The first one was
<a href="https://syntax.fm/show/467/stopping-malicious-actors" target="_blank">stop
malicious actors ↗</a> where Wes and Scott talked aber super interesting
web security topics like API-rate-limiting, mistakes with an IP based approach,
DDOS, nonce-tokens, captchas, CSRF (cross site request forgery).</p>
<p>So many topics to learn more about! I’d love to get more into web security one
day. And I will definitely write some blog posts about it soon!</p>
<p>The second episode I listened to was
<a href="https://syntax.fm/show/446/making-content-what-is-our-process-youtube-blog-posts-courses-conference-talks-and-podcasts" target="_blank">Making
Content × What is our Process? Youtube, Blog Posts, Courses, Conference Talks,
and Podcasts ↗</a>. Wes and Scott share there approach of producing
content and explain more about what works for them and what doesn’t. Very
inspiring and I could take away a lot for my own content producing process!</p>
<p>That’s it for <strong>july 2022</strong> in the web developer diary series. See you next
month!</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Writing blog posts is not easy. In fact I find it difficult. I have days were I
can write a well researched blog post in a few hours. And I have days were I
don’t feel like writing. Or I want to add one more thing but don’t know how to
speak my mind. So this is a reminder to myself: <strong>just hit publish</strong>.</p>

<h3><a name="why-publishing-blog-posts-is-hard"></a> Why publishing blog posts is hard</h3>
<p>When I write a new blog post, I’m always under the impression that everything I
write needs to be 100% true. Well researched, tested, checked again, whatever. I
don’t want to write about stuff I haven’t tried out to the fullest. I want to
know what I’m talking about.</p>
<p>But in most cases, this kind of perfectionism is holding me back. It keeps me
from publishing. It keeps me from finishing blog posts. It’s such a big hurdle.
Everytime I think about adding the final touches to a blog post, I’m not capable
of producing the mental effort that would be necessary.</p>
<p>That’s why my column for “almost finished blog posts” in my notion document gets
longer every week. And unfortunately I found no way yet to change that. Then I
stumbled over two blog posts, that made me change my perspective on this for
quite a bit.</p>
<h3><a name="make-ugly-things"></a> Make ugly things, it’s better than nothing at all</h3>
<p>The first one is
<a href="https://medium.com/designer-being/make-ugly-things-d6438eb7ba96" target="_blank">Make
ugly things ↗</a> by Srishti Mehrotra. It’s got the perfect subtitle:
<i>it’s better than making nothing at all.</i></p>
<p>I can apply the main points she’s talking about 1:1 on my struggles with
publishing blog posts. In her article she writes about wanting to be perfect,
wanting her work to be perfect. And also having a hard time to achieve great
work with this perception. Because this often leads to procrastination and to
zero results.</p>
<p>She describes herself as someone who strives for perfectionism. I’d like to add
a direct quote of her article here, because I can imagine a lot of people can
relate to that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“As a result, I take forever to get started, and even longer to finish —
especially things that matter to me most, the things I can’t afford to mess up
on. And, guess what… end up doing precisely that!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To escape this vicious circle she started an <strong>ugly sketch bock challenge</strong>. Her
goal was to draw at least one ugly drawing a day. And this actually turned her
into a person who can kickoff creative work easier then before.</p>
<p>It took off the pressure, because the goal was making something ugly, not
something perfect. It gave her more confidence, she favored quantity over
quality which in the end led to more quality.</p>
<p>There are a lof ot learnings and insights here I could apply to my blogging
process. Write more. Do Not try to make it perfect. Assuming that writing more
will lead to publishing with better quality. Sounds great!</p>
<h3><a name="there-is-no-bar"></a> There is no bar</h3>
<p>The other blog post that changed my perspective on writing blog posts is
<a href="https://chriscoyier.net/2022/06/27/there-is-no-bar/" target="_blank">There
is no bar ↗</a> by Chris Coyier. It&#x27;s more like a small note, a gathering
of thoughts rather than a long blog post but it asks the right questions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Why do people have a hard time with that publish button, even on
ready-to-rock personal sites?”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“We’re not shootin’ for the Pulitzer over here […].”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He talks about how everyone profits if you put out that thought you want to talk
about. Rather than to wait until you have the perfect words for it. He suggests
to stop overthinking and just put it out there.</p>
<h3><a name="just-hit-publish"></a> Just hit publish</h3>
<p>So these two blog posts, and also other ones like
<a href="https://matthiasott.com/notes/just-put-stuff-out-there">Just put stuff
out there ↗</a> from Matthias Ott reminded me about the most important
thing about blogging. My motivation to write. It’s <strong>to document and share my
learnings</strong>.</p>
<p>And this doesn’t have to be perfect. It has to be on here. That’s the main goal.
So I’m trying to write everyday for just a few minutes, I will not try to make
it perfect and I will just hit publish.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In this blog post I’m gonna share all the mistakes I made, using React. Lately
there is a lot of dicussions going on around using Reacts useEffect. See my
Today-I-learned posts
<a class="hover:border-b-2 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="/today-i-learned/missusing-use-effect/">missusing useEffect</a> and
<a class="hover:border-b-2 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="/today-i-learned/data-fetching-in-react-18/">data fetching in React 18</a>.</p>
<p>The React team published a brand new documention on using React, which is
fantastic. It’s still in beta but I could already refresh a lot of my knowledge.
The best part of the documentation is the following section:
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect">you might not need an effect <span> ↗</span></a>
.</p>
<p>It’s a whole page on when to not use useEffect and how to use useEffect. It has
so many great real-world examples. I noticed immediately that I use a lot of
patterns which were not the best way to solve things.</p>
<p>This made me realize I need to

. In this blog post I’m gonna share everything I thought I did right when using
React. But noticed now, I can solve it in a better way, according to the new
react docs.</p>

<h3><a name="updating-state-based-on-props-or-state"></a>Updating state based on props or state</h3>
<p>A common pattern I often used, was updating state when specific props changed. I
almost always used an effect for this. Listen when this props change, fire the
effect, update it. Guess what: You don’t need an effect for that! It’s
unnecessary! And, as I learned now: inefficient! To quote the react docs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;When something can be calculated from the existing props or state, don’t put
it in state. Instead calculate it during rendering.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Don’t ❌:</p>
<pre class="mb-12"><code class="hljs language-jsx"><span class="hljs-comment">// ...</span>

<span class="hljs-title class_">React</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">useEffect</span>(<span class="hljs-function">() =&gt;</span> {
  <span class="hljs-title function_">setFulladress</span>(<span class="hljs-string">`<span class="hljs-subst">${street}</span> <span class="hljs-subst">${zipcode}</span>`</span>)
}, [street, zipcode])

<span class="hljs-comment">// ...</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Do ✅:</p>
<pre class="mb-12"><code class="hljs language-jsx"><span class="hljs-comment">// ...</span>

<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> [street, setStreet] = <span class="hljs-title class_">React</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">useState</span>(<span class="hljs-string">&#x27;main street&#x27;</span>)
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> [zipcode, setZipcode] = <span class="hljs-title class_">React</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">useState</span>(<span class="hljs-string">&#x27;70180&#x27;</span>)

<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> fullAdress = <span class="hljs-string">`<span class="hljs-subst">${street}</span> <span class="hljs-subst">${zipcode}</span>`</span>

<span class="hljs-comment">// ...</span>
</code></pre>
<h3><a name="dont-use-useeffect-for-expensive-caching"></a>Don’t use useEffect for expensive caching</h3>
<p>In this example we get three values as props, and based on them run an effect.
Inside this effect we run a function to sort our data and set it into state.</p>
<p>Don’t ❌:</p>
<pre class="mb-12"><code class="hljs language-jsx"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">MyProfile</span> = (<span class="hljs-params">{ name, lastname, hobbies }</span>) =&gt; {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> [contactDetails, setContactDetails = <span class="hljs-title function_">useState</span>(<span class="hljs-literal">null</span>)

	<span class="hljs-title function_">useEffect</span>(<span class="hljs-function">() =&gt;</span> {
		<span class="hljs-title function_">setContactDetails</span>(<span class="hljs-title function_">getContactSortedByHobbiesAndName</span>(name, lastname, hobbies)
	}, [name, lastname, hobbies]
}
</code></pre>
<p>This is, again, unnecessary and inefficient. We shouldn’t use useEffect to cache
something like that. We don’t need to! We can remove the state, the whole
useEffect and once more calculate this value during render!</p>
<p>Do ✅:</p>
<pre class="mb-12"><code class="hljs language-jsx"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">MyProfile</span> = (<span class="hljs-params">{ name, lastname, hobbies }</span>) =&gt; {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> contactDetails = <span class="hljs-title function_">getContactSortedByHobbiesAndName</span>(
    name,
    lastname,
    hobbies
  )
}
</code></pre>
<p>As you may have already noticed, this is almost the same pattern as in the first
example. But the React docs add another improvement to it. Imagine our function
here is doing some expensive filtering by comparing thousands of rows. With a
small adjustion we can add free caching to that, without using useEffect!</p>
<p>Even better ✅✅:</p>
<pre class="mb-12"><code class="hljs language-jsx"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">MyProfile</span> = (<span class="hljs-params">{ name, lastname, hobbies }</span>) =&gt; {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> contactDetails = <span class="hljs-title function_">useMemo</span>(<span class="hljs-function">() =&gt;</span> {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">getContactSortedByHobbiesAndName</span>(name, lastname, hobbies)
  }, [name, lastname, hobbies])
}
</code></pre>
<p>By adding useMemo we can cache this expensive filter or sort operation. It tells
React that it does not need to re-run the inner function unless name, lastname
or hobbies changes.</p>
<h3><a name="use-a-cleanup-function"></a>Use a cleanup function when doing a fetch in useEffect</h3>
<p>I already talked a bit about how I used useEffect wrong in a today-i-learned
post. The key takeaways from this were, that data fetching in react works, but
you need a cleanup function. Otherwise you will face race conditions.</p>
<p>A classic data fetching in useEffect example, which I’ve done a lot, could look
like this:</p>
<p>Don’t ❌:</p>
<pre class="mb-12"><code class="hljs language-jsx"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">Searchbar</span> = (<span class="hljs-params">{ searchTerm }</span>) =&gt; {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> [data, setData] = <span class="hljs-title function_">useState</span>(<span class="hljs-literal">null</span>)

  <span class="hljs-title function_">useEffect</span>(<span class="hljs-function">() =&gt;</span> {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> response = <span class="hljs-title function_">fetchFromSearchAPI</span>(searchTerm)
    <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> data = response.<span class="hljs-title function_">json</span>()
    <span class="hljs-title function_">setData</span>(data)
  }, [searchTerm])
}
</code></pre>
<p>There is one big problem here. If a user triggers this search a few times and
kicks off separate fetches, there is nothing implemented to handle stale
responses. This might result in “wrong” results, which is a race condition. As
the react docs put it: two different requests “raced” against each other and
came in a different order than you expected.</p>
<p>The best way to fix this, is to add a cleanup function:</p>
<p>Do ✅:</p>
<pre class="mb-12"><code class="hljs language-jsx"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">Searchbar</span> = (<span class="hljs-params">{ searchTerm }</span>) =&gt; {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> [data, setData] = <span class="hljs-title function_">useState</span>(<span class="hljs-literal">null</span>)

  <span class="hljs-title function_">useEffect</span>(<span class="hljs-function">() =&gt;</span> {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">let</span> reset = <span class="hljs-literal">false</span>
    <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> response = <span class="hljs-title function_">fetchFromSearchAPI</span>(searchTerm)
    <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> data = response.<span class="hljs-title function_">json</span>()

    <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (!reset) {
      <span class="hljs-title function_">setData</span>(data)
    }

    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> <span class="hljs-function">() =&gt;</span> {
      reset = <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>
    }
  }, [searchTerm])
}
</code></pre>
<p>This ensures, React will only take the last response from the API and your
component will avoid race conditions.</p>
<h3><a name="avoid-passing-data-to-the-parent"></a>Avoid passing data to the parent</h3>
<p>Another pattern I used almost every time when working in a React project is
passing data from the child to the parent. Imagine you have a child component,
which fetches some data. You pass a callback function to it as props to get the
data to the parent.</p>
<p>Don’t ❌:</p>
<pre class="mb-12"><code class="hljs language-jsx"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">Header</span> = (<span class="hljs-params"></span>) =&gt; {
	<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> [data, setData] = <span class="hljs-title function_">useState</span>(<span class="hljs-literal">null</span>)

	<span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> (
		<span class="xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">SearchBar</span>
			<span class="hljs-attr">onChange</span>=<span class="hljs-string">{setData}</span>
		/&gt;</span></span>
	)
}

<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">Searchbar</span> = (<span class="hljs-params">{ onChange }</span>) =&gt; {

	<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> data = <span class="hljs-title function_">fetchSearchResults</span>()

	<span class="hljs-title function_">useEffect</span>(<span class="hljs-function">() =&gt;</span> {
		<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> (data) {
			<span class="hljs-title function_">onChange</span>(data)
		}

	}, [onChange, data]
}

</code></pre>
<p>This pattern seems weird at first. But it helped me for several specific use
case a lot, where it made sense to me to fetch the data in the child component.
But the obvious improvement here is to lift state up.</p>
<p>Do ✅:</p>
<pre class="mb-12"><code class="hljs language-jsx"><span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">Header</span> = (<span class="hljs-params"></span>) =&gt; {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> data = <span class="hljs-title function_">fetchSearchResults</span>()

<p>The data gets fetched in the parent component and then passed down to the child
component. As the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html">React docs <span> ↗</span></a>
put it: React is all about one-way data flow down the component hierarchy. Makes
error tracing a lot easier. Even though there were some arguments for the child
data fetching, it’s always better to lift it up.</p>
<h3><a name="conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3>
<p>There are a lot of key take aways from this article. The main thing, that got
stuck in my head is, to think twice whenever I write useEffect in the future. In
most cases I don’t need to! The other key take aways are:</p>
<ul>
<li>if it’s possible, calculate something during render and not in an effect</li>
<li>you don’t need effects to transform data for rendering</li>
<li>if your code should run because it should be displayed to the user, use an
effect</li>
<li>if you fetch data deep down in your component tree, but the parent also needs
this state, lift it up</li>
<li>if you want to fetch data in an useEffect, add a cleanup function</li>
</ul>
<p>The new react docs talk about a lot more situations where you might not need an
effect, with better examples and even some challenges for you. It’s awesome that
they took the time to write something so detailed and helpful. I’m glad I could
rethink some patterns which I thought were the best practices.</p>
<p>Grab a cup of coffee (or your favorite beverage) and take your time to read
through it:

. It’s so worth it and I learned a lot.</p>]]></content:encoded>

            <description><![CDATA[In number 2 of my web developer series I write about finishing big projects, celebrating our marriage, having covid and starting new projects.]]></description>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/web-developer-diary-2.webp" alt="an open notebook"/></p>
<p>I started this series last month. As we all now, time flies and here we are
again for <strong>web developer diary #2</strong>, the june issue.</p>
<p>June was a crazy month. Less because of work but mainly because me and my wife
got married! It needed a good amount of planning to make sure work won’t get too
stressful this month. Almost all energy and time was needed for the organization
of our wedding.</p>
<h3>Work</h3>
<p>As I already said, I figured I needed to block a lot of time for others things
than work. That’s why we managed to launch one of the biggest projects I’ve
worked on so far as a freelancer right away at the start of june.</p>
<p>It’s the website <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="http://dieda.de">dieda.de <span> ↗</span></a> and I’m pretty happy with the
result. It has a lot of interactive parts which were a lot of fun to develop. I
worked on it together with my friends from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://www.werk8.design/">Werk8 <span> ↗</span></a>.
It was our first project together and I think there will be a lot more to come.</p>
<p>The push to production went pretty smooth. We prepared and planned a lot before
hand so we knew that not a lot could go wrong. The only hickup was a little
confusion with the redirects. But we managed to resolve it quickly.</p>
<p>Once again a great go-live checklist is a life-safer in this case. I will
definitely write a blog post soon about how I prepare for a website launch.</p>
<p>The website runs, it’s pretty fast and the client is really happy. Success!</p>
<p>Besides from this big launch I worked on some smaller projects, which were a lot
less work, thanks to
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://github.com/marcoheine-com/website-starter-kit">my starter kit <span> ↗</span></a>. It was
really worth the time I put into this project.</p>
<p>Other than working on client projects I started to produce content again for my
own website. I have a lot of great blog posts almost finished, I can’t wait to
publish! I’m also in the flow of publishing 3-5 today-I-learned posts a month.
It brings me a lot of joy to work on content for my site and I hope I can keep
it up.</p>
<h3>Blog posts of the month</h3>
<p>I published two blog posts this month. The first one of course was the kick off
of this series, which I enjoyed writing very much. It feels so good to look back
and reflect on what happened and how it shapes the now.</p>
<p>The second blog post was about my
<a class="hover:border-b-2 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="/blog/website-starter-kit/">website-starter-kit</a>.</p>
<h3>TIL posts of the month</h3>
<p>I managed to publish 3 Today-I-Learned posts this month, which I’m pretty happy
about.</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="hover:border-b-2 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="/today-i-learned/write-great-alt-text/">How to write great alt text</a></li>
<li><a class="hover:border-b-2 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="/today-i-learned/automatic-er-diagrams/">Automatic ER diagrams</a></li>
<li><a class="hover:border-b-2 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="/today-i-learned/missusing-use-effect/">Missusing useEffect</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I got a lot more on my notion doc and my
<a class="hover:border-b-2 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="/today-i-learned/">today-I-learned page</a> is turning out great. It has got the
different tags you can filter for and the search functionality, which I use a
lot.</p>
<h3>Everything else than web dev</h3>
<p>As I already mentioned in the beginning: I got married! It was wonderful and
amazing at the same time. A magical experience. I never thought I would say
things like that but that’s the way I feel about it.</p>
<p>We celebrated two wonderful parties. The first one was the official ceremony
with our family and closest friends. The second one was a big party with all the
people we love.</p>
<p>After our wedding we started our honeymoon with a great time in south tyrol. I
get it now why everyone I know loves to go there. Beautiful nature, great food,
great weather, nice people and just a 5 hour drive. And the best thing: it’s
Italy!</p>
<p><img src="/images/view-from-meran.webp" alt="view of the landscape around meran"/></p>
<h4>🏋🏻‍♂️ Fitness &amp; Health</h4>
<p>I felt good at the beginning of the month. I did a lot of smaller workouts and
one hour long gravel rides. Due to preparing and celebrating our wedding, I did
not find time for longer workouts or rides. But that didn’t bother me too much.
I felt healthy and fit. Plot twist: than I got Covid.</p>
<p>It’s funny that you can spot the exact time frame when it happened in my apple
watch rings.</p>
<p><img src="/images/apple-watch-rings-june-2022.webp" alt="screenshot of my apple watch rings in june 2022"/></p>
<p>I’m negative now and free of symptoms but still recovering. My heart beat is
still pretty high even when I just go for a little walk. I definitely need to
relax for the next two weeks and don’t do anything too heavy.</p>
<h4>📚 Reading</h4>
<p>I finished two books this month:</p>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/48715024-drau-en-gehen">Christian Sauer - Draußen gehen <span> ↗</span></a>
(only available in german I think)</li>
<li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28000.Postcards">Annie Proulx - Postcards <span> ↗</span></a></li>
</ul>
<p>The first one was about the sane thing of walking outside. The author brings it
into the context of creative techniques. He also explains why it’s beneficial to
your work. I liked a lot of his ideas. Even though if you could summarize it as:
when you’re stuck on a problem, go for a walk.</p>
<p>The second one was Annie Proulx’s famous debut book. It’s just so different from
everything I read and that’s what it makes so special for me.</p>
<p>I also started a new book
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50993.East_of_the_Mountains?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_16">David Guterson - Rast of the mountains <span> ↗</span></a>.
I’m really into it right now and like the story and where it’s going.</p>
<p>The
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://www.goodreads.com/challenges/11636?ref=nav_profile_rc">reading challenge <span> ↗</span></a>
stands on 9 books read out of 30, so a lot more to go. But I think I’m gonna
make it.</p>
<h4>🕹 Video Games</h4>
<p>Didn’t find a lot of the time to play Elden Ring but got close to the end. I
think I’ve never put so much time into a video game and I don’t regret a minute
of it. Still I’m not feeling it that much right now so maybe take a break of it
for now.</p>
<p>I’m tempted to start playing with my Switch again, haven’t finished Mario
Odyssey!</p>
<h4>🎙 Podcasts</h4>
<p>I listened to the
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://syntax.fm/show/454/wtf-is-the-edge-edge-compute-functions">Syntax episode about edge functions <span> ↗</span></a>.
I’ve heard so much about it and wanted to learn more on this topic. Wes and
Scott talk about what this is all about, the upsides and downsides and what
they’re used for. Can recommend!</p>
<p>That’s it for <strong>june 2022</strong> in the web developer diary series. See you next
month!</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><img src="/images/wip.png" alt="an image of a woman thinking"/></p>
<p>I’ve started working as a <strong>freelance web developer</strong> in february 2022 and so
far it’s been a lot of fun. Helping people to get their content, product or
services online feels very <strong>rewarding</strong>. On the other hand it often feels like
having <strong>three jobs at the same time</strong>. So improving processes plays a major
role in getting better at freelancing.</p>
<p><strong>Table of Contents:</strong></p>
<hr class="my-10"/>
<ul>
<li><a class="hover:border-b-2 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="#improving-the-process">Improving the process</a></li>

</ul>
<hr class="my-10"/>
<h2><a name="improving-the-process"></a> Improving the process</h2>
<p>After my first few client projects I noticed that a lot of the requirements are
the same and I keep <strong>copy and pasting code</strong> from one project to another.</p>
<p>Additionally the setup process of a new project often was the same. This brought
me to the point where I saw the case for a having an (almost) blank page to kick
things off, a white label, a website starter kit.</p>
<p>Note: Of course I know that this is not a big deal and I guess every developer
has their own templates to get started.</p>
<p>But nevertheless I wanted to write about my starter kit, the main parts of it
and what worked best for me so far. To reflect on my decisions and also gain
insights from others and what works best for them.</p>
<h2><a name="the-main-parts"></a> The main parts</h2>
<p>So here it is, my
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://github.com/marcoheine-com/website-starter-kit">website starter kit <span> ↗</span></a>.</p>
<p>It’s basically a setup of</p>
<ul>
<li>NextJS with TypeScript,</li>
<li>TailwindCSS for styling</li>
<li>Prismic as a headless CMS with pre-modeled and pre-built components</li>
<li>Linting with eslint and prettier</li>
</ul>
<p>With this setup I’ve already accomplished a lot of different use cases for
client projects.</p>
<p>From basic one-pagers, to landing pages with a handful of subpages, to big
corporate pages with dozens of subpages and web app features like filtering,
sorting, searching, connecting to a database, multiple API routes and
integrating different third-party services.</p>
<p>I have the feeling that this starter kit is ready for all of it and whenever I
start a new client project now, I just use it as a base and get started from
there real quick.</p>
<p>Without thinking or taking the time to setup and install dependancies. This
feels really cool.</p>
<h2><a name="why-ive-chosen-these-technologies"></a> Why I’ve chosen these technologies and honorable mentions</h2>
<h3>NextJS with TypeScript</h3>
<p><strong>NextJS</strong> is just so easy and fun to use, the documentation is fantastic and
all the sites I build with it are super fast, using the static generation
approach. So this was a no-brainer.</p>
<p>But I have to say, after playing a bit with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://remix.run/">Remix <span> ↗</span></a> I’m
hoping it will get more popular and get a Prismic integration one day.</p>
<p>I can totally imagine switching NextJS for Remix, because it makes things even
easier and more natural.</p>
<h3>TailwindCSS</h3>
<p>I’ve read all the discussion around TailwindCSS and I understand some of them.
At the end of the day I’m so much faster when I use Tailwind for styling in
comparison to styled-components, which I’ve used for all my projects before.</p>
<section class="my-10 flex flex-col bg-[#edf6ff] px-10 pt-5 pb-2 md:ml-6"><h3>Hi Friend!</h3><p>If you enjoy my writings and learn something from them, you can consider to <strong>support me</strong>! One way of doing this is just as easy as <strong>buying me a Coffee!</strong></p><p>Thanks so much! This means a lot to me and is a great way to <strong>support my work</strong>.</p><a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/marcoheine" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="mb-4 inline-block self-center rounded-md bg-[#79d6b5] p-2 font-bold text-black hover:text-white"><span role="img" aria-label="coffee emoji">☕️</span> Buy me a coffee <span role="img" aria-label="coffee emoji">☕️</span> </a></section>
<h3>Prismic</h3>
<p>The market for headless CMS is huge and I could fill a whole page just about
them. I’ve tried a few and I liked Prismic the most. This is based on their
content modeling approach with custom types and slices.</p>
<p>But it is also mainly based on their editor interface. I have the feeling that
this is more accessible than others for non developers and this is a major
selling point for me.</p>
<p>But this starter kit does not only contain the integration part of prismic as a
CMS. It also has pre-modeled and pre-built components, that almost every website
uses. Like header, footer, menu or text-image.</p>
<h3>Linting with eslint and prettier</h3>
<p>No one wants to manually format code. I’ve worked in a project years ago where
there was no automated code formatting and it was horrible. Hours spent by
setting code on the same line. Ugh.</p>
<p>So integrating eslint together with prettier is a no-brainer. Renaming
variables, forgetting one file and you get errors and don’t know why. Not
anymore with basic linting done by eslint.</p>
<p>That’s it, thats my website starter kit, the foundation from what I start all my
projects right now. I’m really curious when I’m going to change things here and
how long I’m going to use this.</p>
<p>What is your stack? What technologies are you using all the time together? I’m
really curious to know! Send me an <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="mailto:marco@marcoheine.com">email <span> ↗</span></a> with
your thoughts on this.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>With this blog post, I’ll start a new series: the <strong>Web Developer Diary</strong>
series!</p>
<p>I saw this idea on Dave Ruperts
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://daverupert.com/2022/05/vibe-check-16/">blog <span> ↗</span></a>. He calls it vibe check
and it’s a <strong>check-in</strong> at the end of every month, to <strong>reflect</strong> on things that
happened during this month - work-whise and in private.</p>
<p>I really like this format, because I do a monthly reflection on things anyway
with my <em>“Ein guter Plan”</em> planner
(<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://einguterplan.de/">https://einguterplan.de/ <span> ↗</span></a>) (sorry, only available in
german!).</p>
<p>So without any further ado, let’s start this <strong>Web Developer Diary series</strong> and
see what happened in May 2022!</p>
<h2>Work</h2>
<p>I started <strong>freelancing</strong> back in february with one of the biggest projects I’ve
ever worked on and this month was the time of adding the final touches and
preparing everything for <strong>the big launch</strong>. It’s a NextJS static-generated
website where we used Prismic as headless CMS and vercel for deployment and
hosting. This combination is genuinely so much fun to work with. The site is
predominantly static generated content, but the amount of content is A LOT.</p>
<p>I wasn’t sure how user-friendly Prismic is with a ton of documents and custom
types and if we would lose track immediately. But turns out: their filter and
search functionality is actually great. All the people who were adding content
into the CMS were pretty happy with it, which makes me confident in using
Prismic for bigger projects in the future again.</p>
<p>Besides all the static pages this project also included a lot of <strong>interactive</strong>
parts, which made the development challenging and very exciting. That included
the possiblity of filtering and sorting items, a pretty cool interactive map,
and a powerful search based on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://www.algolia.com/">algolia <span> ↗</span></a>. Implementing
a search with algolia was very intuitive and rewarding. It’s the first time I
used it and I can highly recommand it.</p>
<p>Besides this big project I also worked on some smaller projects, using the tech
stack mentioned above.</p>
<p>For the first time ever I did some <strong>client outreach</strong> by myself. This means
reasearching companies who have bad websites or no website at all and contacting
them with reasons why a great website will benefit them. I took away <strong>three key
learnings</strong> from that:</p>
<ul>
<li>A lot of companies still do not have a website and have only a facebook or an
instagram page and this really shocks me</li>
<li>A lof of companies still have really bad websites. Using outdated jQuery
versions, 10s loading times or more, not accessible at all and just looking
terrible</li>
<li>It’s really motivational to tell someone why a good website should be
important and a priority to them. That confirms me in why I do what I do and
why I like it so much.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Blog posts of the month</h2>
<p>Unfortunalety I didn’t find the time to finish a blog post completely this
month. But I have some posts in my “almost finished” columns and I’m pretty
excited to publish them in the next weeks.</p>
<p>I’ve already learned so much in this first few months of freelancing, I could
spend a whole week of just writing down everything I learned and turning that
into blog posts. I hope this web developer diary will bring me back into writing
blog posts regularly again!</p>
<h2>TIL posts of the month</h2>
<p>I did find the time to add some new Today-I-Learned posts this month, which
makes me really happy.</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="hover:border-b-2 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="/today-i-learned/headless-wordpress/">Headless wordpress</a></li>
<li><a class="hover:border-b-2 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="/today-i-learned/post-vs-put/">POST vs. PUT</a></li>
<li><a class="hover:border-b-2 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="/today-i-learned/confetti/">Confetti</a></li>
<li><a class="hover:border-b-2 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="/today-i-learned/most-common-accessibility-issues/">Most common accessibility issues</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I also played around a bit with my <a class="hover:border-b-2 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="/today-i-learned/">Today-I-learned page</a>,
added some nice animations and the coolest part: <strong>a search functionality</strong>!
It’s basically just a client-side filter which checks several parts of the posts
with <code>.includes()</code> but it works pretty well and I use it a lot!</p>
<p>Stay tuned for more Today-I-learned posts in the next weeks, my draft folder
gets bigger and bigger.</p>
<h2>Everything else than web dev</h2>
<h3>🏋🏻‍♂️ Fitness &amp; Health</h3>
<p>Concerning working out this month was quite a good one. I managed to close my
rings on my apple watch on 22 days. I missed my standing goal only on 2 days
which makes me very happy.</p>
<p><img src="/images/apple-watch-rings-may-2022.webp" alt="screenshot of closed apple watch rings"/></p>
<p>I managed to fit in one, or two workouts every week. My current workout routine
consists of</p>
<ul>
<li>3 sets of pullups alternating with 3 sets of pistol squats</li>
<li>3 sets of pushups alternating with 3 sets of ring dips</li>
<li>and 3 sets of arching active hang</li>
</ul>
<p>The last one is my progression path to achieving the front lever one day.</p>
<p>Besides bodyweight exercises I rode my bike a lot and I already can feel how I
get fitter. It&#x27;s a Focus Atlas 6.7 gravel bike and it was one of the best things
I got myself this year. For me it&#x27;s the perfect combination between mountain
biking and riding fast and I&#x27;m having a lot of fun.</p>
<h3>📚 Reading</h3>
<p>I finished two books this month:</p>
<ul>
<li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56920684-the-anomaly">The Anomaly <span> ↗</span></a> by
Hervé le Tellier</li>
<li><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54860573-once-there-were-wolves">Once there were wolves <span> ↗</span></a>
by Charlotte McConaghy</li>
</ul>
<p>I liked them both a lot. The latter even made me shed a few tears.</p>
<p>I also started a new book, it’s
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28000.Postcards">Postcards <span> ↗</span></a> by Annie Proulx
and I’m really excited about it. It’s the one book who made her win her first
award. I loved Shipping news and Accordion Crimes and I’m really interested what
this book will be like.</p>
<p>I’m currently at 7 books read this year and my goal are 30. You can follow the
progress of

<h3>🕹 Video Games</h3>
<p>I bought an Xbox Series S back in march only for one reason: I wanted to play
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/elden-ring">Elden Ring <span> ↗</span></a>. And what can I
say: I think this is the best game I’ve ever played. The open world is so
enjoyable to explore, the boss fights are unique and a lot of fun and I did not
have on minute where I regretted buying a new console for the sole purpose of
playing one specific game.</p>
<p>If you’re also playing: I’m currently 84h in and level 100.</p>
<p>I’m no expert in the souls games, I just have a lot of fun playing them. I’m
really curious on how long it will take me to finish this game.</p>
<p>That’s it for <strong>may 2022</strong> in the web developer diaries series. See you next
month!</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It&#x27;s not. And never will. You can <strong>relax</strong> and stop searching for alternative
career ideas. In my opinion Github Copilot is one of the <strong>best things</strong> that
could happen to us developers in the current state of (web) development.</p>
<p>In this blog post I will explain why I think this is the case.</p>
<p><strong>What you can learn from this blog post:</strong></p>
<hr class="my-10"/>

<hr class="my-10"/>
<h2><a name="what-is-it"></a> What is GitHub Copilot</h2>
<p>GitHub Copilot was announced on June 29th 2021 as your <strong>AI pair programmer</strong>.
You can read the introduction blog pos over here:
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://github.blog/2021-06-29-introducing-github-copilot-ai-pair-programmer/">https://github.blog/2021-06-29-introducing-github-copilot-ai-pair-programmer/ <span> ↗</span></a></p>
<p>It claims to <strong>help you write better code</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>GitHub Copilot draws context from the code you’re working on, suggesting whole
lines or entire functions. It helps you quickly discover alternative ways to
solve problems, write tests, and explore new APIs without having to tediously
tailor a search for answers on the internet.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>As you type, it adapts to the way you write code—to help you complete your
work faster.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As soon as I read the announcement I was hyped. I was tired of writing the same
JavaScript code over and over again. Mapping over arrays, manipulating part of
the data and returning it as some sort of HTML. Sometimes I feel like I&#x27;m
<strong>doing nothing else than that</strong>.</p>
<p>I immediately felt like I knew where GitHub Copilot would make my life easier.
Without getting scared that it would do ALL the work.</p>
<h2><a name="what-can-it-do"></a> What can GitHub Copilot do</h2>
<p>As I saw the first few posts coming in from people who where lucky enough to try
it out, I felt supported in my gut feeling, in my assumption in what Github
Copilot could do - and what not.</p>
<p>People showed how GitHub Copilot knew where they were going when writing a
specific function. It took the <strong>tedious work</strong> from their shoulders by writing
out the detailed specifics for them. And this was so cool to see.</p>
<p>I entered my email to join the waiting list and after a few weeks I got the
invitation to the repository and was able to install the Visual studio code
extension.</p>
<p>My first few tries were pretty basic. I defined a function and GitHub Copilot
knew by the name of this function what logic I wanted to write inside of it.</p>
<p>I created a new file, imported React and it suggested the skeleton of a whole
functional component.</p>
<p>I started to use the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="http://array.prototype.map">Array.prototype.map <span> ↗</span></a> function
on an Array of data I got from a GraphQL query and it suggested to manipulate
parts of the data and knew how to return it as semantic HTML.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m still at the beginning of using the advantages of GitHub Copilot but I
already miss it here in Notion where I&#x27;m writing this blog post as there are no
suggestions.</p>
<p><strong>But GitHub Copilot is not just auto-completion</strong>. You can turn <strong>comments into
code</strong>. You can use it to write repetitive code. It can even write <strong>tests</strong> for
you. And it can show you how to write a certain part of your code in a different
way.</p>
<p>I already notice how this makes me <strong>faster and more confident</strong>. I really feel
like I have a copilot with me all the time, a second pair of eyes, supporting me
and making my code less error-prone.</p>
<p>This gives me a lot of <strong>confidence when tackling new problems</strong>.</p>
<p>Maybe this will eliminate the time spent on searching the internet and
understanding how <code>Array.prototype.reduce</code> works for the 317th time.</p>
<p>I also can image that GitHub Copilot will make learning and working with a
language you&#x27;re not that familiar with a way better experience.</p>
<p>This are just my first impressions on it. You can checkout the documentation
here: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://copilot.github.com/">https://copilot.github.com/ <span> ↗</span></a></p>
<p>It shows a lot of detailed examples and usecases.</p>
<h2><a name="why-its-not-stealing-our-jobs"></a>Why it&#x27;s not stealing our developer jobs</h2>
<p>So when this GitHub Copilot is doing all our work, is it stealing our jobs?</p>
<p>Do we still need people to program? Do we still need human beings for web and
software development?</p>
<section class="my-10 flex flex-col bg-[#edf6ff] px-10 pt-5 pb-2 md:ml-6"><h3>Hi Friend!</h3><p>If you enjoy my writings and learn something from them, you can consider to <strong>support me</strong>! One way of doing this is just as easy as <strong>buying me a Coffee!</strong></p><p>Thanks so much! This means a lot to me and is a great way to <strong>support my work</strong>.</p><a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/marcoheine" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="mb-4 inline-block self-center rounded-md bg-[#79d6b5] p-2 font-bold text-black hover:text-white"><span role="img" aria-label="coffee emoji">☕️</span> Buy me a coffee <span role="img" aria-label="coffee emoji">☕️</span> </a></section>
<p>Of course this is a highly philosophical and controversial questions because it
points into the direction of &quot;Can AI take over?&quot;.</p>
<p>I&#x27;m no expert in AI at all and in no means can I answer this questions. <strong>But I
know that GitHub Copilot will not steal our jobs</strong>.</p>
<p>I know this could sound naive and maybe in a few years we&#x27;re all unemployed and
you can tell me: &quot;I told you so&quot;. But I strongly believe that this is not the
case.</p>
<p>My assumption is, that <strong>AIs like GitHub Copilot will help and support us</strong>.
They will make our lives easer. But this doesn&#x27;t mean we won&#x27;t have jobs
anymore.</p>
<p>This means we have more time to care for the more complex and bigger problems,
we claim to solve with web and software development.</p>
<p>This means we can solve some tasks faster and have more energy for higher
obstacles.</p>
<p>In the end a human being is always needed to point something like GitHub Copilot
into a certain direction. We have to tell it what kind of function we want to
write, to solve this problem in a certain way.</p>
<p>The <strong>creativity</strong> comes from us, that&#x27;s one of humans biggest strengths. I know
that AI can become creative too, as we&#x27;ve seen with numerous examples of AI
creating art and music.</p>
<p>But I strongly believe that the best outcome will always be achieved <strong>when
humans and AI work together</strong>.</p>
<p>We&#x27;re still at the very beginning and GitHub Copilot will learn more and more
about how we program. I&#x27;m very excited how this turns out.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Clear communication, always ask questions, check what you really should care for
(hint: it&#x27;s not the shiny tech stack) and always be nice. My colleagues taught
me alot. Here&#x27;s part 2 of my learnings.</p>
<p>This blog post is part 2 of a series. Make sure to check out
<a class="hover:border-b-2 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="/blog/most-important-things-i-learned-from-my-former-colleagues-part-1/">part 1</a>
aswell.</p>
<p><strong>What you can learn from this blog post:</strong></p>
<hr class="my-10"/>
<ul>
<li><a class="hover:border-b-2 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="#ask">Hesitate to ask a question? Do it anyway!</a></li>
<li><a class="hover:border-b-2 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="#communicate">Communicate clearly</a></li>
<li><a class="hover:border-b-2 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="#getting-along">You won&#x27;t get along with everybody, and that&#x27;s okay</a></li>
<li><a class="hover:border-b-2 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="#users">We care for the user and their problem (not for the fancy new tech we used to implement this feature)</a></li>
<li><a class="hover:border-b-2 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="#be-nice">Be nice</a></li>
</ul>
<hr class="my-10"/>
<h3><a name="ask"></a> Hesitate to ask a question? Do it anyway!</h3>
<p>We all know that feeling. You&#x27;re sitting in a meeting with a bunch of people.
Someone explains the details of a complex topic. They ask, if everyone
understands the topic. Everyone nods.</p>
<p>But you don&#x27;t understand and you have a lot of questions. But you really
hesitate to ask. Everyone clearly signalled, that they understood it. So why
even bother?</p>
<p>And, if it&#x27;s a &quot;stupid&quot; question, you don&#x27;t want to embarass yourself. What if
the problem is just that you haven&#x27;t listened well enough?</p>
<p>Forget about all this. <strong>It doesn&#x27;t matter</strong>. If you still have questions and
don&#x27;t understand something well enough, ask! Ask again. And again.</p>
<p>Because if you&#x27;re the one who is implementing this feature later and you don&#x27;t
understand it, that&#x27;s the real problem. Then you really wasted a lot of time.</p>
<p>In most cases, everyone didn&#x27;t understand everything. And they will be so
thankful to you, that you asked this question. Because it&#x27;s hard to admit, that
you have a hard time following along.</p>
<p>So the next time you hesitate to ask a question - <strong>do it anyway</strong>.</p>
<h3><a name="communicate"></a> Communicate clearly</h3>
<p>Communication is hard. In my opinion, for being a good developer your
communication should be a <strong>number one priority</strong>. Communication is one of the
topics where a lot of things can go wrong.</p>
<p>So communicating clearly and improving your communication steadily is so
important.</p>
<p>By clearly I mean <strong>being honest</strong>. Tell your team members what your current
status is. Tell your manager when there is a problem. Don&#x27;t tell them you can
solve it in five minutes if you don&#x27;t know yet what the root cause is.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t wait till a few hours before the deadline to communicate that you can&#x27;t
make it.</p>
<p><strong>Good communication solves problems before they arise and prevents bugs and
errors</strong>. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s a desirable goal.</p>
<h3><a name="getting-along"></a> You won&#x27;t get along with everybody, and that&#x27;s okay</h3>
<p>We as humans want to be liked. We want to belong. We want to become a part of a
group or stay a member of a group and we do a lot for that goal. That&#x27;s our
nature.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s even harder when you notice that you&#x27;re having a hard time dealing with
someone. You have different opinions, you always disagree, you always favor
different solutions.</p>
<p>Deep in your heart you want to be on the same page with this person.</p>
<p>But you won&#x27;t and can&#x27;t get along with everybody and that&#x27;s <strong>totally okay</strong>.</p>
<section class="my-10 flex flex-col bg-[#edf6ff] px-10 pt-5 pb-2 md:ml-6"><h3>Hi Friend!</h3><p>If you enjoy my writings and learn something from them, you can consider to <strong>support me</strong>! One way of doing this is just as easy as <strong>buying me a Coffee!</strong></p><p>Thanks so much! This means a lot to me and is a great way to <strong>support my work</strong>.</p><a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/marcoheine" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="mb-4 inline-block self-center rounded-md bg-[#79d6b5] p-2 font-bold text-black hover:text-white"><span role="img" aria-label="coffee emoji">☕️</span> Buy me a coffee <span role="img" aria-label="coffee emoji">☕️</span> </a></section>
<p>Sometimes you need people who question everything. Even if it&#x27;s annoying to you
it can have a lot of <strong>benefits</strong> for the development. Rethinking ideas is a
valuable aspect of product development.</p>
<p>If you happen to find such a person, <strong>don&#x27;t despair</strong>. Be glad, it&#x27;s a good
thing!</p>
<h3><a name="users"></a> We care for the user and their problem (not for the fancy new tech we used to implement this feature)</h3>
<p>If you break it down to one thing that we&#x27;re doing in web development, it&#x27;s
<strong>we&#x27;re solving problems of people</strong>. We have users whos lifes we want to make
<strong>easier and better</strong>.</p>
<p>That&#x27;s what the job is for. That&#x27;s the only thing we should care for.</p>
<p>Of course we need to make decisions on which tech stack to use, how to implement
certain things. We should make these decisions based on the team members we
have. The knowledge we have. But all of these considerations should point at the
user.</p>
<p>Imagine you have three team members who are proficient in TypeScript,. This
means you can develop this certain feature pretty fast with a high quality
standard. Which means the user will benefit a lot from it.</p>
<p>Using another programming language because everyone is using it right now would
be a really bad decision in this case.</p>
<p>You would have to learn the language. It could be of bad quality because you&#x27;re
not experienced and it would take much longer. And, in the end, the user would
not benefit from it at all.</p>
<p>So always remember: we care for the user and want to solve their problem. Every
decision making should be geared towards this.</p>
<h3><a name="be-nice"></a> Be nice</h3>
<p>I thought about a long explanation with a lot of different examples of why being
nice is so much <strong>better</strong> than yelling, being angry, blaming someone. But this
should be <strong>common sense</strong>.</p>
<p>Being nice opens way more doors and has infinite benefits. And in the end it&#x27;s
the one thing that does not harm anyone. <strong>Just be nice</strong>.</p>

<p>I call myself extremely lucky. I had and still have the opportunity to work
together with some <strong>extraordinary human beings.</strong></p>
<p>They helped me and others to <strong>grow</strong> and get better at what we&#x27;re doing. Not
only in technical matters but also in soft skills.</p>
<p>This blog post is for me. To always remind me about the most important things I
learned from my colleagues working in the web development industry. And maybe
you can take away something from it, too.</p>
<p><strong>What you can learn from this blog post:</strong></p>
<hr class="my-10"/>
<ul>
<li><a class="hover:border-b-2 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="#humans">We write code for humans, not machines</a></li>
<li><a class="hover:border-b-2 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="#team">It&#x27;s always we - not you alone</a></li>

</ul>
<hr class="my-10"/>
<h3><a name="humans"></a> We write code for humans, not machines</h3>
<p>Do you know that feeling when you used a cool feature of your favorite
programming language? Or refactored a long function? Or turned a long function
into a one liner?</p>
<p>And do you also know the feeling of coming back to this code after a few weeks
and <strong>not understanding a single thing</strong> that is happening there?</p>
<p>You might have had good intentions– improving the code base. But if you don&#x27;t
put much thought into it and just refactor something because one-line functions
are &quot;cool and smart&quot;, you&#x27;re making things <strong>worse</strong>.</p>
<p>Imagine how this must feel for your fellow co-workers who didn&#x27;t even write the
code. They need a lot of <strong>mental processing</strong> to follow along here.</p>
<p>So always remember: <strong>we write code for humans, not for machines.</strong> I know in
the end it&#x27;s the machine who compiles and runs the code. But for the most part,
code should be <strong>human readable.</strong> It should be written for humans so other
humans can understand, change and improve your code.</p>
<h3><a name="team"></a> It&#x27;s always we - not you alone</h3>
<p>We are a team. We work together as a team and the code, the products, the
features we release are the result of this team work. Nobody is responsible for
something alone. Its always a <strong>team effort.</strong></p>
<p>I know how it feels to implement a whole new feature by yourself and you feel
the urge to tell everyone about it. That&#x27;s just your ego talking.</p>
<p>Of course you can be proud of yourself. Celebrate yourself, acknowledge what
your capable of.</p>
<p>But don&#x27;t forget the work of your teammates that also played a major role in it.
From the conception of the feature to the design, the code review to the
testing. It&#x27;s always a &quot;we did this together&quot;.</p>
<h3><a name="senior"></a> Seniority has nothing to do with age</h3>
<p>When I started working in web development I was often under a certain
impression. I thought that after working for a few years in this area you
<strong>automatically</strong> turn into a <strong>senior developer.</strong> You get this shiny new
title, more money and more respect.</p>
<p>It took me a while until I figured out, that this is <strong>not how it works.</strong> Just
because you&#x27;re growing older doesn&#x27;t mean you become a senior. There is so much
more to seniority than just age.</p>
<p>For me personally getting to a senior level means, developing into a specific
person. A person who can <strong>teach</strong>, <strong>motivate</strong> and get the best out of all
their team members. Who has a lot of experience but doesn&#x27;t brag about it.</p>
<p>Who can <strong>lead</strong> others and also <strong>follow</strong> their advice. Who has a lot of
ideas, opinions but also acknowledges others and can admit when they are
<strong>wrong</strong>.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a person you want to <strong>look up to.</strong> A person you look forward to <strong>learn</strong>
more from everyday. And became someone like them eventually.</p>
<p>These are just a few facts and this description only <strong>scratches the surface</strong>.
My good friend Dom wrote a
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://islovely.co/posts/how-to-go-from-junior-to-senior-developer">fantastic blog post <span> ↗</span></a>
about this topic.</p>
<p>I have one planned too on the senior subject, so make sure to check-in again in
a few weeks!</p>
<h3><a name="finger-pointing"></a> No finger pointing</h3>
<p>When things go wrong and you know your colleague messed up, it&#x27;s super easy to
point at them and shout &quot;they did this, they are responsible&quot;! Don&#x27;t be that
person. It&#x27;s <strong>not helpful</strong> in any way.</p>
<p>Of course you need to find solutions for problems and figure out everything that
lead to a specific outcome. But pointing at someone and blame them is the
<strong>wrong way</strong> to handle it.</p>
<p>Why? It&#x27;s the same I already wrote about above in &quot;It&#x27;s always we - not you
alone&quot;. We are a team and we are always responsible for things as a team, no
matter if it&#x27;s about success or failure.</p>
<p>When we know that someone contributed to a problem we can talk to them, help
them to improve and tell them what to do next time, so it doesn&#x27;t happen again.</p>
<p>Fixing problems always works better without finger pointing.</p>

<h3><a name="under-promise"></a> Underpromise - overdeliver</h3>
<p>When I started as a web developer I was always super proud of the things I did.
And I always wanted to show people what kind of cool things I could make.</p>
<p>This also led to the thing that I could not make <strong>realistic estimates.</strong> I
always wanted to make something super cool and shiny at all costs.</p>
<p>So if someone suggested to build a specific feature and I loved the idea, I
would want to build it without actually thinking about the real effort and time
it would take. I just wanted to do it.</p>
<p>Maybe I already knew from the start that it could take much longer than
expected. But I wanted to ignore that fact and make everyone proud.</p>
<p>Sooner or later I came to the conclusion that this wasn&#x27;t helpful. If you
promise something and can&#x27;t deliver, you have to break your promise.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s way easier and healthier to under promise.</p>
<p>And if all goes well and you have more time for something than expected you
still can over deliver.</p>
<p><strong>These are the first 5 things I learned from my colleagues working in web
development. This is part one of a series, so stay tuned for more!</strong></p>]]></content:encoded>

<h3>How I got to know go</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Wait, what? What&#x27;s happening here? Your previous blog posts were all about
frontend development, CSS JavaScript, React. Now this..go? What is it? And why
are you blogging about it?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If this new content on my blog confuses you a little, I&#x27;m sorry! A lot of new
things happened to me in the last months and one of them is, that I&#x27;m <strong>taking a
closer look</strong> on both (all?) sides of web development. Which includes working
with and learning more about <strong>backend technologies</strong>.</p>
<p>My first contact with everything else than frontend was in a project were we
worked with <strong>NodeJS/Express</strong> and <strong>MongoDB</strong>.</p>
<p>This granted me a lof ot knowledge on how all parts of a web application work
together. <strong>From the frontend, to API Calls, middlewares, services, raw SQL and
to the database</strong>.</p>
<p>In the project I&#x27;m working in right now, we&#x27;re using <strong>go</strong> in the backend and
therefore I&#x27;m learning go!</p>
<p>And to make the most of it I will <strong>document</strong> everything I learn about go in
this blog post. So I have a place to come back to and look at when I forget
everything.</p>
<p>And maybe you can learn something from it too!</p>
<h3>So...go. What is it?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple,
reliable, and efficient software.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At least that&#x27;s what it says about itself on its website. Let&#x27;s see what
wikipeda has to say about go:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Go is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google by
Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. Go is syntactically similar to
C, but with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and
CSP-style concurrency. The language is often referred to as Golang because of
its domain name, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="http://golang.org/">golang.org <span> ↗</span></a>, but the proper name is Go.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ah that tells a bit more about it. Interesting! Now that we are behind the get
to know each other phase, let&#x27;s see what <strong>topics</strong> I&#x27;ll cover in this blog
post. As the title says it will be an absolute beginner introduction.</p>
<p>If I&#x27;m wrong about something or made mistakes, please let me know!</p>

<h3><a name="packages"></a>packages, import, export</h3>
<p>Every go program is made up of packages. You always have to have a <strong>main
package</strong>, where your app starts. You can <strong>import</strong> your own packages or one of
the hundreds of go packages.</p>
<p>A name (of a function, struct etc) is <strong>exported</strong> and therefore can be imported
if it begins with a capital letter.</p>
<pre class="mb-12"><code class="hljs language-go"><span class="hljs-keyword">package</span> main

<span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> (
	<span class="hljs-string">&quot;fmt&quot;</span>
	<span class="hljs-string">&quot;math&quot;</span>
)

<span class="hljs-comment">// is not exported</span>
<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">func</span> <span class="hljs-title">main</span> <span class="hljs-params">()</span></span> {
	PrintStr()
}

<span class="hljs-comment">// can be imported from other packages in your app</span>
<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">func</span> <span class="hljs-title">PrintStr</span> <span class="hljs-params">()</span></span> {
	fmt.Printf(<span class="hljs-string">&quot;Hello World&quot;</span>)
	fmt.Println(math.Pi)
}
</code></pre>
<h3><a name="variables"></a> Variables</h3>
<p>There are several ways to declare variables in go. The classic <code>var</code> lets you
declare one or more variables at once. The <code>const</code> lets you declare constant
variables. The <code>:=</code> shorthand lets you declare and initialize a variable at once
inside a function.</p>
<pre class="mb-12"><code class="hljs language-go"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> a = <span class="hljs-number">10</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> <span class="hljs-number">1</span> = <span class="hljs-number">10</span>

<span class="hljs-comment">// shorthand for declaring and initializing a a variable inside a function</span>
a := <span class="hljs-number">10</span>
</code></pre>
<h3><a name="functions"></a> Functions</h3>
<p>A function in go can take <strong>zero or more arguments</strong>. The type of the input
parameter comes after the variable name. When the parameters have the same type
you can combine the type declaration.</p>
<p>The input parameters are followed by the return type.</p>
<p>A function can return any number of results. In go explizit returns are
required.</p>
<pre class="mb-12"><code class="hljs language-go"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">func</span> <span class="hljs-title">multiply</span> <span class="hljs-params">(a, b <span class="hljs-type">int</span>)</span></span> <span class="hljs-type">int</span> {
	<span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> a * b
}

multiply(<span class="hljs-number">3</span>, <span class="hljs-number">6</span>)
</code></pre>
<h3><a name="data-types"></a> Data types</h3>
<p>Surprise, surprise go has values like boolean, strings and integer. Here&#x27;s a
list of all of them.</p>
<pre class="mb-12"><code class="hljs language-go"><span class="hljs-type">bool</span>

<span class="hljs-type">string</span>

<span class="hljs-type">int</span>  <span class="hljs-type">int8</span>  <span class="hljs-type">int16</span>  <span class="hljs-type">int32</span>  <span class="hljs-type">int64</span>
<span class="hljs-type">uint</span> <span class="hljs-type">uint8</span> <span class="hljs-type">uint16</span> <span class="hljs-type">uint32</span> <span class="hljs-type">uint64</span> <span class="hljs-type">uintptr</span>

<span class="hljs-type">byte</span> <span class="hljs-comment">// alias for uint8</span>

<span class="hljs-type">rune</span> <span class="hljs-comment">// alias for int32</span>
     <span class="hljs-comment">// represents a Unicode code point</span>

<span class="hljs-type">float32</span> <span class="hljs-type">float64</span>

<span class="hljs-type">complex64</span> <span class="hljs-type">complex128</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Variables declared without an initial value are given their zero value:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>0</code> for numeric types,</li>
<li><code>false</code> for the boolean type, and</li>
<li><code>&quot;&quot;</code> (the empty string) for strings</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="for"></a> for</h3>
<p>Coming from TypeScript, there is no such thing as the array methods map, reduce
or filter in go. The for loop is all you have.</p>
<p>A for loop consists of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>an <strong>init</strong> statement; condition expression; <strong>post</strong> statement</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no need for <strong>parenthesis</strong> surrounding the three components. The init
and post statements are <strong>optional</strong>.</p>
<p>The for loop can also be used as while().</p>
<pre class="mb-12"><code class="hljs language-go"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> a = <span class="hljs-number">10</span>

<span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> i := <span class="hljs-number">0</span>; i &lt; a; i++ {
	a += i
}
</code></pre>
<h3><a name="if-else"></a> if, else</h3>
<p>If, else is pretty straight forward in go. No parenthesis are needing
surrounding the condition.</p>
<pre class="mb-12"><code class="hljs language-go"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> a = <span class="hljs-number">10</span>

<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> a &gt; <span class="hljs-number">9</span> {
	fmt.Println(a)
}
</code></pre>
<h3><a name="switch"></a> switch</h3>
<p>A switch in go only runs the selected case, not all cases that follow. The
default case is <strong>optional</strong>.</p>
<p>The break statement is provided automatically.</p>
<p>You can combine expressions in the same case by using comma separation.</p>
<pre class="mb-12"><code class="hljs language-go"><span class="hljs-keyword">switch</span> time.Now().Weekday() {
    <span class="hljs-keyword">case</span> time.Saturday, time.Sunday:
        fmt.Println(<span class="hljs-string">&quot;It&#x27;s the weekend&quot;</span>)
    <span class="hljs-keyword">default</span>:
        fmt.Println(<span class="hljs-string">&quot;It&#x27;s a weekday&quot;</span>)
}
</code></pre>
<h3><a name="struct"></a> struct</h3>
<p>A struct is a typed collection of fields. Structs are <strong>mutable</strong>.</p>
<pre class="mb-12"><code class="hljs language-go"><span class="hljs-keyword">type</span> server <span class="hljs-keyword">struct</span> {
	host          <span class="hljs-type">string</span>
	port          <span class="hljs-type">string</span>
}
server{<span class="hljs-string">&quot;localhost&quot;</span>, <span class="hljs-string">&quot;8080&quot;</span>}

<span class="hljs-keyword">type</span> person <span class="hljs-keyword">struct</span> {
	name <span class="hljs-type">string</span>
	age <span class="hljs-type">int</span>
}
person{name: <span class="hljs-string">&quot;Marco&quot;</span>, age: <span class="hljs-number">29</span>}
</code></pre>
<h3><a name="arrays"></a> arrays</h3>
<p>Arrays are numbered sequences of elements of a specific length.</p>
<p>The following creates a variable a as an array of 10 integers.</p>
<pre class="mb-12"><code class="hljs language-go"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> a [<span class="hljs-number">10</span>]<span class="hljs-type">int</span>
</code></pre>
<p>In go arrays can not be resized, because the length is part of the type.</p>
<p>The built-in <strong>len</strong> method returns the length of an array.</p>
<pre class="mb-12"><code class="hljs language-go"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> names [<span class="hljs-number">3</span>]<span class="hljs-type">string</span>{<span class="hljs-string">&quot;Tim&quot;</span>, <span class="hljs-string">&quot;Mandy&quot;</span>, <span class="hljs-string">&quot;Stefanie&quot;</span>}
<span class="hljs-built_in">len</span>(names) <span class="hljs-comment">// 2</span>
</code></pre>
<h3><a name="slices"></a> slices</h3>
<p>Unlike arrays, slices have no specified length, so they are dynamically sized.
They are build on arrays but are more powerful and therefore more used than
arrays in go.</p>
<p>To create <strong>dynamically</strong> sized arrays (slices), you can use the <strong>make</strong>
function.</p>
<pre class="mb-12"><code class="hljs language-go"><span class="hljs-comment">// slice of type in with length 5</span>
a := <span class="hljs-built_in">make</span>([]<span class="hljs-type">int</span>, <span class="hljs-number">5</span>)

<span class="hljs-comment">// slice of type string with length 3</span>
s := <span class="hljs-built_in">make</span>([]<span class="hljs-type">string</span>, <span class="hljs-number">3</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>Slices can also be build by slicing an existing array or slice. In the following
example, a slice is formed on the numbers array by specifying two indices, a low
and high bound.</p>
<pre class="mb-12"><code class="hljs language-go"><span class="hljs-comment">// array</span>
numbers := [<span class="hljs-number">5</span>]<span class="hljs-type">int</span>{<span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">2</span>, <span class="hljs-number">3</span>, <span class="hljs-number">4</span>, <span class="hljs-number">5</span>}

<span class="hljs-comment">// slice of numbers array</span>
specificNumbers := names[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>:<span class="hljs-number">3</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>Its also possible to create <strong>slices of slices.</strong></p>
<pre class="mb-12"><code class="hljs language-go">board := [][]<span class="hljs-type">string</span>{
		[]<span class="hljs-type">string</span>{<span class="hljs-string">&quot;_&quot;</span>, <span class="hljs-string">&quot;_&quot;</span>, <span class="hljs-string">&quot;_&quot;</span>},
		[]<span class="hljs-type">string</span>{<span class="hljs-string">&quot;_&quot;</span>, <span class="hljs-string">&quot;_&quot;</span>, <span class="hljs-string">&quot;_&quot;</span>},
		[]<span class="hljs-type">string</span>{<span class="hljs-string">&quot;_&quot;</span>, <span class="hljs-string">&quot;_&quot;</span>, <span class="hljs-string">&quot;_&quot;</span>},
	}
</code></pre>
<p>To enhance a slice, you can use the <strong>append</strong> function. This is one example of
what makes slices more powerful than arrays. Append returns a slice with one or
more new values.</p>
<pre class="mb-12"><code class="hljs language-go"><span class="hljs-keyword">var</span> s []<span class="hljs-type">int</span>

<span class="hljs-built_in">append</span>(s, <span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">3</span>, <span class="hljs-number">4</span>, <span class="hljs-number">5</span>)
</code></pre>
<p>Slices can also be <strong>copied</strong>.</p>
<pre class="mb-12"><code class="hljs language-go">s := <span class="hljs-built_in">make</span>([]<span class="hljs-type">string</span>, <span class="hljs-number">5</span>)

s[<span class="hljs-number">0</span>] = <span class="hljs-string">&quot;H&quot;</span>
s[<span class="hljs-number">1</span>] = <span class="hljs-string">&quot;e&quot;</span>
s[<span class="hljs-number">2</span>] = <span class="hljs-string">&quot;l&quot;</span>
s[<span class="hljs-number">3</span>] = <span class="hljs-string">&quot;l&quot;</span>
s[<span class="hljs-number">4</span>] = <span class="hljs-string">&quot;o&quot;</span>

c := <span class="hljs-built_in">make</span>([]<span class="hljs-type">string</span>, <span class="hljs-number">5</span>)

<span class="hljs-built_in">copy</span>(c, s)

</code></pre>

<h3><a name="map"></a> map</h3>
<p>A map is combination of key value pairs. In other languages it&#x27;s often called
dictionary.</p>
<pre class="mb-12"><code class="hljs language-go"><span class="hljs-comment">// creates an empty map of string - int key - value pairs</span>
m := <span class="hljs-built_in">make</span>(<span class="hljs-keyword">map</span>[<span class="hljs-type">string</span>]<span class="hljs-type">int</span>)

<span class="hljs-comment">// sets an the key &quot;age&quot; with the value of 29</span>
m[<span class="hljs-string">&quot;age&quot;</span>] = <span class="hljs-number">29</span>

<span class="hljs-comment">// deletes an element of a map</span>
<span class="hljs-built_in">delete</span>(m, <span class="hljs-string">&quot;age&quot;</span>)
</code></pre>
<h3><a name="range"></a> range</h3>
<p>To iterate over a map or a slice you can use <strong>range</strong>.</p>
<p>It returns two values: index and a copy of the element at that index.</p>
<p>The index or value can be skipped by using <code>_</code></p>
<pre class="mb-12"><code class="hljs language-go">numbers := []<span class="hljs-type">int</span>{<span class="hljs-number">1</span>, <span class="hljs-number">2</span>, <span class="hljs-number">3</span>, <span class="hljs-number">4</span>, <span class="hljs-number">5</span>}

<span class="hljs-keyword">for</span> i, num := <span class="hljs-keyword">range</span> numbers {
	fmt.Printf(i, num)
}
</code></pre>
<h3><a name="method"></a> method</h3>
<p>A method is a function with a special <strong>receiver argument</strong>.</p>
<pre class="mb-12"><code class="hljs language-go"><span class="hljs-keyword">type</span> Server <span class="hljs-keyword">struct</span> {
	host          <span class="hljs-type">string</span>
	port          <span class="hljs-type">string</span>
}

function (s Server) printServer() {
	fmt.Printf(s)
}
</code></pre>
<p>See that we pass the Server as s as a <strong>receiver</strong> argument to the <code>printServer</code>
function before we the function name declaration?</p>
<p>Everything inside the function body has now <strong>access</strong> to the members of the
struct.</p>
<h3><a name="pointers"></a> pointers</h3>
<p>Pointers hold the <strong>memory address</strong> of a value.</p>
<pre class="mb-12"><code class="hljs language-go">i := <span class="hljs-number">42</span>

<span class="hljs-comment">// generate a pointer to i</span>
p = &amp;i

<span class="hljs-comment">// read i through the pointer p</span>
fmt.Prinln(*p)
</code></pre>
<h3><a name="pointer-receivers"></a> pointer receivers</h3>
<p>Methods can be declared with pointer receivers.</p>
<p>The differences between pointer receivers and value receivers are:</p>
<ul>
<li>pointer receivers can modify the value to which the receiver points</li>
<li>with pointer receivers you can avoid copying the value on each method call</li>
<li>sending the value of the variable to the function, but not the variable itself</li>
<li>the value of the variable isn’t passed to the function, just its location</li>
<li>pointers are adresses to a particular place in memory</li>
</ul>
<pre class="mb-12"><code class="hljs language-go"><span class="hljs-keyword">type</span> Server <span class="hljs-keyword">struct</span> {
	host          <span class="hljs-type">string</span>
	port          <span class="hljs-type">string</span>
}

function (s *Server) printServer() {
	fmt.Printf(s)
}
</code></pre>
<p>Pointers and pointer receivers are little bit more <strong>advanced topic</strong> but it&#x27;s
good to have heard of them as a beginner.</p>
<h3><a name="interfaces"></a> interfaces</h3>
<p>Interfaces are <strong>named collections</strong> of method signatures. To implement an
interface you just need to implement all methods in the interface.</p>
<pre class="mb-12"><code class="hljs language-go"><span class="hljs-keyword">type</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">interface</span> {
	methodOne() <span class="hljs-type">int</span>
	methodTwo() <span class="hljs-type">int</span>
}

<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">func</span> <span class="hljs-title">methodOne</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span></span> <span class="hljs-type">int</span> {}

<span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">func</span> <span class="hljs-title">methodTwo</span><span class="hljs-params">()</span></span> <span class="hljs-type">int</span> {}
</code></pre>
<h3><a name="errors"></a> errors</h3>
<p>A <strong>nil</strong> value in the error position indicates that there was no error.</p>
<pre class="mb-12"><code class="hljs language-jsx"><span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> err != nil {
	<span class="hljs-comment">// log the error</span>
}
</code></pre>
<p>Calling code should handle errors by <strong>testing</strong> whether the error equals nil.</p>
<p>And that is it, these are the <strong>programming with go beginner topics</strong> I came

<h2><a name="avoid-anonymous-funcs"></a>Avoid anonymous functions</h2>
<p>It&#x27;s easy to use an anonymous function when you want to add a quick callback
function to a component.</p>
<pre class="mb-12"><code class="hljs language-jsx"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> * <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">React</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> <span class="hljs-string">&#x27;react&#x27;</span>

</code></pre>
<p>But if you&#x27;re on the lookout for a quick performance win, that&#x27;s something you
can avoid.</p>
<p>Anonymous functions aren&#x27;t assigned an identifier like const/let/var. This means
they <strong>are not persistent</strong> whenever this functional component gets rendered
again. So JavaScript has to <strong>create them again and again,</strong> on every rerender.</p>
<p>This becomes a problem if you&#x27;re rendering a lot of elements, like a lot of
table cells, which all make use of an anonymous function.</p>
<p>There is an easy way to solve this. You can change it to a <strong>named
function</strong>.</p>
<pre class="mb-12"><code class="hljs language-jsx"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> * <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">React</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> <span class="hljs-string">&#x27;react&#x27;</span>

  <span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">handleClick</span> = (<span class="hljs-params"></span>) =&gt; {
    <span class="hljs-variable language_">console</span>.<span class="hljs-title function_">log</span>(<span class="hljs-string">&#x27;Button clicked&#x27;</span>)

<p>That&#x27;s it for quick-win number 4: avoid anonymous functions!</p>
<h2><a name="defining-objects"></a>Define objects outside of your component</h2>
<p>Here comes quick-win number 5. Something similar as described above can be
applied to objects.</p>
<p>If you define an object as an object literal and pass it in as props, this object
will have to be recreated on every rerender.</p>
<pre class="mb-12"><code class="hljs language-jsx"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> * <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">React</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> <span class="hljs-string">&#x27;react&#x27;</span>

      This is the text of my component.
    <span class="hljs-tag">&lt;/<span class="hljs-name">div</span>&gt;</span></span>
  )
}

<span class="hljs-keyword">export</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">default</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">MyComponent</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Instead, define your object outside of the component. Now it is created once on
the initial render and not being touched on every rerender.</p>
<pre class="mb-12"><code class="hljs language-jsx"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> * <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">React</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> <span class="hljs-string">&#x27;react&#x27;</span>

<h2><a name="lazy-suspense"></a>React.lazy and React.Suspense</h2>
<p>With <code>React.lazy</code>, you can &quot;lazy load&quot; your components. This means your component
is only rendered when it is truly needed and not loaded unnecessarily.</p>
<p>The less you need to load, the better your performance!</p>
<p>This can easily be combined with React.Suspense for rendering some fallback
content.</p>
<p>I wrote a whole Today-I-learned post about this topic; check it out here:
<a class="hover:border-b-2 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="/today-i-learned/react-suspense-lazy-loading/">Today I learned: React Suspense lazy-loading</a></p>
<p>That&#x27;s also a great way to improve your React performance without too much
effort.</p>
<h2><a name="virtualized-lists"></a>Virtualized lists</h2>
<p>If you&#x27;ve worked with long lists or tables with many rows in React, you
know how much this can impact your performance. This is because you have to render a lot of
content, usually many divs.</p>
<p>We already learned that too many DOM nodes are not a good idea. Also updates and
rerenders can be painful because they take just way too long.</p>
<p>With virtualized lists, only the list items that are actually in
the viewport are rendered. That&#x27;s pretty cool. But how does this work? Don&#x27;t worry; you won&#x27;t
have to build this yourself. There are already excellent tools out there that do
the job for you.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferer">react-virtualized ↗</a> by
Brian Vaughn.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s pretty easy to use, and you don&#x27;t need to worry about displaying long lists
and tables anymore.</p>
<p>So that&#x27;s it; these are my <strong>7 easy ways to improve your React performance</strong>.
Did you already know all of them? Do you have any additional tips? Let me know!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>At the beginning of the year I wrote a blog post about
<a class="hover:border-b-2 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="/blog/react-performance-improvements/">React performance improvements</a>. It‘s
one of my favourite blog posts I ever wrote. It’s a great example of documenting
everything while you learn it.</p>
<p>It’s a very in depth analysis. It shows you how to <strong>test and measure</strong> the
performance of your React application and a lot of ways how to improve it. In
the contrary this blog post has the goal to give you a lot of <strong>quick wins</strong> for
your performance. Things you can change and adjust, without too much effort.</p>
<p>So you can see it as an <strong>addition</strong> to my original react performance blog post.
The first one builds the foundation. This one adds the cherry on top.</p>
<p>This post is <strong>part 1</strong> of a <strong>series</strong>.</p>
<p>Part 2: <a class="hover:border-b-2 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="/blog/7-easy-ways-to-improve-your-react-performance-part-2/">7 easy ways to improve your React performance - part 2</a></p>
<p><strong>What you can learn from this blog post:</strong></p>

<h3><a name="keys"></a> Always use a key when mapping (and not an index)</h3>
<p>When mapping over an array and rendering a list of items, make sure you <strong>always
use keys</strong> for every item.</p>
<p>Keys help React identify which items have <strong>changed, are added, or are
removed</strong>. Keys should be strings that identify a list item, such as an ID.</p>
<p>Here is a quick example of the usage of keys. Check the return method of this
component. There we use the id of every animal as a key.</p>
<pre class="mb-12"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> * <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">React</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> <span class="hljs-string">&#x27;react&#x27;</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> { <span class="hljs-title class_">AnimalCard</span> } <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> <span class="hljs-string">&#x27;./animal-card&#x27;</span>

<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> animals = [
  {
    <span class="hljs-attr">id</span>: <span class="hljs-number">1</span>,
    <span class="hljs-attr">name</span>: <span class="hljs-string">&#x27;dog&#x27;</span>,
  },
  {
    <span class="hljs-attr">id</span>: <span class="hljs-number">2</span>,
    <span class="hljs-attr">name</span>: <span class="hljs-string">&#x27;cat&#x27;</span>,
  },
  {
    <span class="hljs-attr">id</span>: <span class="hljs-number">3</span>,
    <span class="hljs-attr">name</span>: <span class="hljs-string">&#x27;unicorn&#x27;</span>,
  },
]

<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">Animals</span> = (<span class="hljs-params"></span>) =&gt; {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> animals.<span class="hljs-title function_">map</span>(<span class="hljs-function">(<span class="hljs-params">animal</span>) =&gt;</span> {

  })
}

<span class="hljs-keyword">export</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">default</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">Animals</span>
</code></pre>
<p>If you&#x27;re not using keys, React has to a hard time to figure out which items to
update. This can lead to updating every item although only one changed.</p>
<p>This can be a massive performance impact! 😫</p>
<p>If you don&#x27;t have access to unique identifiers, indexes can be used as a last
resort. It is <strong>not recommended</strong> to use them as keys but it&#x27;s better than not
using any keys at all.</p>
<p>If the order of items changes, the index changes as well so React has to update
every item anyway.</p>
<p>You can learn more about why keys are important in this

<p>So that&#x27;s it for quickwin number one: <strong>always use a key when mapping!</strong></p>
<h3><a name="fragments"></a> Use React.Fragments instead of divs as JSX parent element</h3>
<p>Next up: quickwin number two.</p>
<p>When you return multiple elements from a component, JSX needs a parent element
to wrap them. A quick way to do this, is to put a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> around them.</p>
<p>I admit it, I&#x27;ve done this too, way too many times.</p>
<pre class="mb-12"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> * <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">React</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> <span class="hljs-string">&#x27;react&#x27;</span>

<span class="hljs-keyword">const</span> <span class="hljs-title function_">MyComponent</span> = (<span class="hljs-params"></span>) =&gt; {

  )
}

<span class="hljs-keyword">export</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">default</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">MyComponent</span>
</code></pre>
<p>But the next time you need a JSX wrapping element, think again! You can use a
<strong>React.Fragment</strong> for that!</p>
<pre class="mb-12"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> * <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">React</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> <span class="hljs-string">&#x27;react&#x27;</span>

  )
}

<span class="hljs-keyword">export</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">default</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">MyComponent</span>
</code></pre>
<p>And the best thing is, there is even a <strong>short syntax</strong> for this.</p>
<pre class="mb-12"><code class="hljs language-javascript"><span class="hljs-keyword">import</span> * <span class="hljs-keyword">as</span> <span class="hljs-title class_">React</span> <span class="hljs-keyword">from</span> <span class="hljs-string">&#x27;react&#x27;</span>

</code></pre>
<p>But wait, why does this boost my performance? Good question! Here&#x27;s the thing.
The more DOM elements your React application has, the <strong>longer</strong> the render
process takes.</p>
<p>Google&#x27;s performance tool lighthouse recommends <strong>not more than 1500 DOM nodes</strong>
in total.</p>
<p>So by removing every unnecessary <code>div</code>, like the one we&#x27;ve used way too often as
a JSX parent element wrapper, we already get closer to that goal. And we can
boost our performance!</p>
<p>You can read more about why you should avoid too many DOM nodes in this article:

<h3><a name="usestate"></a> One useState hook instead of multiple for connected data</h3>
<p>Another performance quickwin you can achieve easy, is using one <code>useState</code> hook
instead of multiple ones for connected data.</p>
<p>Imagine a developer built a form with several <code>input</code> elements. Therefore they
added four individual <code>useState</code> hooks.</p>
<p>That could look something like this:</p>

<p>There is a lot of <code>useState</code> and <code>onChange</code> going on here, right? Phew. We can
optimize for the better here!</p>
<p>By <strong>removing</strong> the individual <code>useState</code> hooks and implementing a combined one,
we&#x27;re making sure to <strong>reduce</strong> the size of the component and therefore improve
the performance.</p>
<p>And we can also get rid of all the <code>handleChange</code> functions, which all seem to
do the same.</p>

<p>Wow a lot less code and a lot more <strong>readable</strong>, don&#x27;t you think? It&#x27;s always a
good idea to keep your state in an object, if you&#x27;re dealing with <strong>connected
data</strong>.</p>
<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong: using and calling multiple <code>useState</code> hooks is not a bad
thing! React has no problem with that.</p>
<p>But in this example it&#x27;s also about <strong>removing duplicate code</strong> and
<strong>rethinking</strong> your components.</p>
<p>And if JavaScript has to allocate the memory for only one function instead of
four, that&#x27;s also a <strong>performance quickwin</strong>! And that&#x27;s what we&#x27;re here for,
right?</p>
<p>That&#x27;s it for <strong>part 1</strong> of this <strong>React performance quickwins series</strong>! Hope
you could already apply some of them and make your React app even faster.</p>
<p>Let me know if these tips helped or you have other tips, you&#x27;d like to share.</p>

<p>I was in a comfortable position at a previous job. I was working as a frontend
developer and after two years in this job, I knew my way around. I knew about
every feature our product contained. I knew the code. I could tell which
component was responsible for what.</p>
<p>I knew where most of the questions at me where headed before someone finished
them asking. This felt like home. This felt like the absolute <strong>comfort zone</strong>.</p>

<p>After switching jobs imposter syndrome hit me hard. At first I felt like a
<strong>fraud</strong>. Everything was new to me. The code, the tools, the workflow, the
people, the team. I felt like I had to relearn everything. And like I did not
know anything at all.</p>
<p>I always thought that sooner or later somebody would come to me and say: &quot;You
know, we&#x27;ve watched you long enough and now you&#x27;ve been caught. You don&#x27;t know
anything about software developing.&quot; <em>handcuffs click.</em></p>
<p>Did you ask yourself questions like <strong>am I good enough</strong>? Do you often have
thoughts like do I know enough to be a good developer? Can I help make this
product better? My skills are way to bad. <strong>I should quit. I know nothing</strong>.</p>
<p>This kind of thoughts are bad and not helpful at all you could say. But still a
lot of people have them.</p>
<p>Chances are you&#x27;ve felt the same at some point in your career. Chances are you
will feel like that everytime you start a new job. This all sounds very
negative. But the good news is: <strong>you are not alone</strong>!</p>
<p>A colleague of mine once told me that they should take two weeks off to learn a
specific technology. Because they feel like they &quot;know nothing about it&quot;. And
they are developers, I <strong>learn the most of</strong> and look up to. In my eyes they
know their stuff pretty well.</p>
<p>If anything of this above sounds familiar to you, let me tell you about the
imposter syndrome.</p>
<h3><a name="definition"></a> What is imposter syndrome?</h3>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome">Wikipedia <span> ↗</span></a> gives a very good
definition of imposter syndrome:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Impostor syndrome (also known as impostor phenomenon, impostorism, fraud
syndrome or the impostor experience) is a psychological pattern in which an
individual doubts their accomplishments or talents and has a persistent
internalized fear of being exposed as a &quot;fraud&quot;.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If this sounds familiar to you, chances are you also feel like you <strong>do not
deserve</strong> certain things. You think your achievements are not you own and your
success is attributed to <strong>luck</strong>.</p>
<p>For some people it gets even worse. Often <strong>anxiety, stress or depression</strong> go
along side with imposter syndrome.</p>
<h3><a name="why"></a> Why you feel like an imposter</h3>
<p>So the questions is why do we feel this way? What <strong>causes</strong> imposter syndrome?
It does not sound like something that could benefit our work, our life or
anything between. It sounds harmful and could also hold as back.</p>
<p>A lot of developers are <strong>self taught</strong>. Often they suffer from imposter
syndrome because they do not have a CS degree. And this is still required by a
lot of companies. Thus they think, they are not &quot;real&quot; developers, if they
haven&#x27;t learned their stuff at a university.</p>
<p>Another reason why we feel this way is that the web industry is one of the
<strong>fastest changing industries</strong>. Every week or so this new technology gets
popular. A new JavaScript framework will replace the most popular one right now
and you need to know about it and have learned about it yesterday. Which is
obviously not possible.</p>
<p>So we get the feeling we need no know everything but we can&#x27;t. And we don&#x27;t
accept the obvious reasons, we think we as developers, as humans are the
problem.</p>
<p>There is always something new to learn in this industry. This is on the one hand
a really nice thing and motivates me but but it&#x27;s hard to stay on top.</p>
<p>Every programming task you do at work is like a small challenge. If you succeed
everything is fine. But if you don&#x27;t find a solution right away you question
yourself. You <strong>question your knowledge</strong> and if you&#x27;ve even <strong>capable</strong> of this
job.</p>
<p>We compare ourselves to others. This new kid just joined the company and already
build this super complex feature. Because they are programming since they are 12
years old. I will never be as good as them. Sounds familiar?</p>
<h3><a name="why-not"></a> Why you aren&#x27;t an imposter</h3>
<p>Let&#x27;s take a quick break and a deep breath.</p>
<p>Let me tell you that you took the first step. We analyzed the problem and we saw
the situation for what it really is. There are a lot of ways to grow out of it
and change. From here on the positive takes over.</p>
<p><strong>You are not an imposter</strong> because you do not need a CS degree to be a good
developer. It can help in some ways but the knowledge to be a good developer is
not only trapped inside a CS degree.</p>
<p><strong>You are not an imposter</strong> because take a look. See how far you&#x27;ve come. What
you&#x27;ve achieved in your past, all you&#x27;ve done. Even if you&#x27;re a beginner
remember all the things you&#x27;ve learned so far, even the smallest.</p>

<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CEwsVgKizRo/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><p>(@findingthelittlethings_)</p></a>
<p>I take a look at it as often as I can because it&#x27;s always a <strong>good reminder</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>You are not an imposter</strong> because you&#x27;ve got the job right? You convinced
someone to hire you as a developer. That&#x27;s a big achievement you can&#x27;t fake.</p>
<p><strong>You are not an imposter</strong> because remember this one little crazy bug you
solved which seemed like &quot;a hell no we will never solve this bug at all&quot;. But
you did.</p>
<p><strong>You are not an imposter</strong> because you don&#x27;t know everything. And that&#x27;s
totally fine. <strong>You can&#x27;t know everything</strong>. And even if you could, that would
be really boring, right? One of the greatest things in life is that there is
always something new to learn.</p>
<h3><a name="overcoming"></a> Overcoming imposter syndrome</h3>
<p>Now as we have set the clear picture why you are not an imposter, here are more
tips on how to deal with imposter syndrome and eventually <strong>overcome</strong> it.</p>
<section class="my-10 flex flex-col bg-[#edf6ff] px-10 pt-5 pb-2 md:ml-6"><h3>Hi Friend!</h3><p>If you enjoy my writings and learn something from them, you can consider to <strong>support me</strong>! One way of doing this is just as easy as <strong>buying me a Coffee!</strong></p><p>Thanks so much! This means a lot to me and is a great way to <strong>support my work</strong>.</p><a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/marcoheine" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="mb-4 inline-block self-center rounded-md bg-[#79d6b5] p-2 font-bold text-black hover:text-white"><span role="img" aria-label="coffee emoji">☕️</span> Buy me a coffee <span role="img" aria-label="coffee emoji">☕️</span> </a></section>
<h4><a name="realistic-goals"></a> Set yourself realistic goals</h4>
<p>Set yourself some realistic goals! Telling yourself that in three weeks you will
know the entire codebase by heart is an impossible goal. Rather set up smaller
goals which are <strong>clear</strong> and <strong>measurable</strong>.</p>
<h4><a name="track-accomplishments"></a> Keep track of your accomplishments</h4>
<p>Write down everything you achieved. Even the smallest things. Everytime you
struggle, you doubt yourself, take a look at that list. Be proud of what you&#x27;ve
learned and achieved. This helps a lot.</p>
<h4><a name="dont-compare"></a> Don&#x27;t compare yourself to others</h4>
<p>Comparing yourself to others is never a good idea. It always leaves you feel bad
about yourself. You don&#x27;t know the history of others, how they learn and how
they think. Everyone is different and has their own strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>The next time you compare yourself to the new team member, who already seems to
know everything - stop right there. Be happy for the new colleague because they
settled so quickly.</p>
<p>Than <strong>compare yourself to you</strong> from last week or last month. There are
definitely things you&#x27;ve learned, features you built and bugs you crushed.</p>
<h4><a name="teammates"></a> Your teammates and colleagues may feel the same</h4>
<p>Talk to your colleagues about it. Chances are they feel exactly they same as you
do. Help to build a culture in your company where it&#x27;s easy and desired to share
knowledge. Where you help each other and not knowing everything is considered
normal. Do more pair programming and knowledge sharing sessions.</p>
<p>Learn to be brave and answer questions with: &quot;I don&#x27;t know an answer to your
question right away. I need to think about it first.&quot; I know this seems very
hard, but in the end everyone benefits from that.</p>
<p>Finally be aware of the fact that the work and achievements as a team is, what
counts.</p>
<h4><a name="feedback"></a> Ask for Feedback</h4>
<p>If you&#x27;re feeling like an imposter remember that the only person you get
feedback from right now is yourself. To stop this cycle and get a more realistic
view of what is really happening, don&#x27;t hesitate to ask your teammates and
colleagues for feedback! They can give you valuable answers on how you&#x27;re really
doing and where you can improve.</p>
<h4><a name="experts"></a> Even the experts in our industry feel this way</h4>
<p>When I came across <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://davidwalsh.name/impostor-syndrome">this blog post <span> ↗</span></a>
by David Walsh, I was astonished. He writes a lot of blog posts about the
JavaScript ecosystems. He worked for Mozilla for over 8 years. Developers go to
his blog to get help, read his tutorials and learn stuff. And even he feels this
way. This shows a whole new perspective. Take your time and head over there to
read this. I&#x27;ll wait here.</p>
<p>And than you&#x27;ll see that you&#x27;re absolutely not alone feeling like this. You&#x27;re
fine.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Dealing with imposter syndrome can be hard and your are not alone in this. The
first step is to realize that you suffer from it. From there on you can grow
into a more healthy relationship with yourself. There are a lot of tools you can
use to cope and deal with imposter syndrome.</p>
<p>I hope I could explain this topic a little better and you can use my tips to
overcome imposter syndrome.</p>

way? Make sure to send them this blog post and let me know what you think about

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you would ask me about two good reasons why I like to work with <strong>React</strong> -
and use it primarily when doing frontend development - it would really make me
think.</p>
<p>When I first started to work with React I didn&#x27;t have a real choice. I started
working at a job where there was no question if we should use
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://angular.io/">Angular <span> ↗</span></a>, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue <span> ↗</span></a> or
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte <span> ↗</span></a> or anything else.</p>
<p>No, it was already defined that React would be the weapon of choice and there
was already written a lot of code in React. I was just thrown into this React
hole and never had the chance to crawl back out. End of story.</p>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/O2zL3TVRhZuGk/giphy.gif" alt="a gif of two men walking, one falls into a hole"/></p>
<p>No not really. Of course not. It&#x27;s true that I had no choice back then but I
never stopped thinking about how we would build this feature or solve that
problem without React or with VanillaJS or even without any JavaScript at all!</p>
<p>If you google &quot;Reasons to use React&quot; you get a lot clever points and different
opinions. I even read about advantages of React I never heard about before. I
really have to get into this
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://reactjs.org/docs/concurrent-mode-intro.html">Concurrent Mode stuff <span> ↗</span></a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, after this research my list of reasons grew bigger and bigger but I
noticed despite all this points being true and reasonable arguments there was no
real point where I could put my heart into.</p>
<p>So I set all the lists and research stuff aside, closed all the tabs and really
started thinking.</p>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/B23grX5C9g9sKNt9Xk/giphy.gif" alt="a gif of two girls, sitting on a desk, where one throws all the papers off the desk"/></p>
<p>And this is what I came up with:</p>
<h3>Reason one: popularity</h3>
<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong. I don&#x27;t like React because so many cool people use it and if
they would switch to the next cool thing I would switch too.</p>
<p>When we talk about the web development world one big thing you always hear is:
&quot;have you heard about this new JS framework?&quot;. In our field everything is moving
so <strong>fast</strong> and everything changes really <strong>quickly</strong>.</p>
<p>But if you take a closer look, you will notice that React is here since
<strong>2013</strong>. That&#x27;s like <strong>VERY OLD</strong> in this web thingy. It&#x27;s the one JS framework
with the most GitHub stars (146k in March, 2020) and is used by 3,3 million
people, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://github.com/facebook/react">according to GitHub <span> ↗</span></a>.</p>
<p>To translate this: I don&#x27;t like React because it&#x27;s so popular in general or it
is so &quot;old&quot;. I like it because of all the <strong>perks</strong> these two points bring with
them.</p>
<p>Due to these facts React has a <strong>massive community</strong> behind it. There is always
an active and (in most cases) constructive discussion on Twitter about new
features and problems where you can get help from and learn a lot.</p>
<p>There are super great subreddits like
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs">/r/reactjs <span> ↗</span></a> where every news about React is
being discussed, people present cool tools they built with React and if you need
help, people will take a look at your problem and suggest solutions.</p>
<p>There are so much great tutorials, blog articles, video courses and podcasts on
React which teach you everything about it.</p>
<p>A lot people may have had the same problem or bug as you and there are already
bulletproof solutions available. People help each other whenever they can, which
makes the journey to get better in React a lot of fun.</p>
<p>And finally: React has one of the best
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html">Docs <span> ↗</span></a> I&#x27;ve ever used which gets
better and better everyday.</p>
<h3>Reason two: it&#x27;s just a view library</h3>
<p>React is not a full framework. Instead it focuses on the <strong>view layer,</strong> on
building user interfaces and on building what the user interacts with and what
helps him, accomplish several tasks.</p>
<p>For me, this meant that I did not have that steep of a <strong>learning curve</strong> and it
was very <strong>straightforward</strong> to use. Because the great thing is: if you know
<strong>JavaScript</strong> you&#x27;re good to go! And that is something, which I think, is
really cool.</p>
<p>React comes into action when you have a static website and want to switch to a
website where the focus is on the user interactions and updates of the user
interface.</p>
<p>You just want to build a view that <strong>reacts</strong> on the user input and is clever
enough to only <strong>update</strong> what should be updated. It enables you to take that
step without shipping you overly complex extra stuff you don&#x27;t need. That&#x27;s why
React is your best bet and why I like it so much.</p>
<p>Of course at some point you may need additional tools, which are not included in
React by default - like routing or other state management solutions. But in most
cases you won&#x27;t need these and you&#x27;re good to go with what you get from the
beginning.</p>
<p>So that&#x27;s it, these are my two good reasons to use React. What are yours? Hit me

<h2><a name="where-to-start"></a> Where to start</h2>
<p>If you notice that your React App is <strong>slow</strong> or takes a long time to load, you
have a few options to verify that and get an insight into where the biggest
problems are.</p>
<h3><a name="lighthouse-audit"></a> Chrome DevTools Lighthouse Audit</h3>
<p>First of all you can measure your performance score with the <strong>Chrome Lighthouse
Audit</strong> which is available in the Chrome DevTools.</p>
<p>You can choose between measuring the performance on mobile or desktop. If you
just want to get your performance score, you can check off the other audits,
like Progressive Web App or SEO.</p>
<p><img src="/images/chrome-lighthouse-audit-settings.jpeg" alt="a screenshot of the chrome lighthouse audit settings"/></p>
<p>You should also activate <strong>throtteling</strong>, because not everyone is on the newest
MacBook Pro with 64GB of RAM and i9 processor while browsing on a 5G network. I
usually use Applied Slow 4G, 4x CPU Slowdown.</p>
<p>After the audit is finished, you get a nice <strong>overview</strong> over the scores, the
metrics and how they are calculated. You also get opportunities and diagnostics
which can tell you why your app is slow and how to solve common problems.</p>
<p><img src="/images/chrome-lighthouse-audit.jpeg" alt="a screenshot of the chrome lighthouse audit results"/></p>
<h3><a name="webpagetest"></a> webpagetest</h3>
<p>Another tool to verify the perfomance of your React application is
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://webpagetest.org">webpagetest.org <span> ↗</span></a>. After you enter a URL and start the
test, it returns a test result and grades specific parts of your application. It
is also pretty useful in finding problems and ways to improve the performance.</p>
<h2><a name="the-biggest-problems"></a> The Biggest Problems</h2>
<h3><a name="time-to-interactive"></a> Time to Interactive (TTI)</h3>
<p>In case of React applications where a lot of JavaScript is involved, often the
<strong>time to interactive</strong> identifies itself as the biggest problem. TTI means how
long it takes a page to become <strong>interactive</strong>.</p>
<p>The TTI gets slowed down by a few things. The ones which are directly related to
a lot of JavaScript code and therefore React are:</p>
<ul>
<li>too much main-thread work</li>
<li>an excessive DOM size</li>
<li>too much JavaScript execution time</li>
</ul>
<p>To summarize this: When a user navigates to your page and can not click around
for a few seconds, because your JavaScript is not fully parsed, compiled and
executed, this is <strong>bad</strong>.</p>
<p>Especially when you are using server side rendering where the user already can
see your page but not interact with it yet.</p>
<section class="my-10 flex flex-col bg-[#edf6ff] px-10 pt-5 pb-2 md:ml-6"><h3>Hi Friend!</h3><p>If you enjoy my writings and learn something from them, you can consider to <strong>support me</strong>! One way of doing this is just as easy as <strong>buying me a Coffee!</strong></p><p>Thanks so much! This means a lot to me and is a great way to <strong>support my work</strong>.</p><a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/marcoheine" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" class="mb-4 inline-block self-center rounded-md bg-[#79d6b5] p-2 font-bold text-black hover:text-white"><span role="img" aria-label="coffee emoji">☕️</span> Buy me a coffee <span role="img" aria-label="coffee emoji">☕️</span> </a></section>
<p>This all happens because your browser has to execute too much JavaScript at
once, because certain scripts are blocking, because you just want to do too much
at once in your code.</p>
<p>Uff. This sounds a little exausting. We need solutions. Let&#x27;s tackle the
problems one by one.</p>
<h2><a name="how-to-solve-them"></a> And how to solve them</h2>
<h3><a name="removing-dom-nodes"></a> Removing DOM Nodes</h3>
<p>Perhaps the easiest step to improve the performance of your react application is
to <strong>reduce</strong> the amout of DOM Nodes. If you hide a lot of your components with
CSS, check if you can render them <strong>conditionally</strong> instead.</p>
<p>This decreases the size of the DOM which means less components need to be
rendered, which means less JavaScript needs to be executed.</p>
<p>This will especially be helpful, when you have a long list of items, render all
of them, but show only the first 5 initially. Robin Wieruch has a
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://www.robinwieruch.de/conditional-rendering-react">great article <span> ↗</span></a> on
conditional rendering in React.</p>
<h3><a name="lazy-loading-images"></a> lazy-loading images</h3>
<p>If you load twenty images initially, which are located at the bottom of your
page, meaning the user can&#x27;t see them at first glance, this is a lot of wasted
time and potential.</p>
<p>Instead you can detect when the user gets closer to the images and then render
them. Because that&#x27;s the point where you actually need them. The npm package
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-lazyload">react-lazyload <span> ↗</span></a> makes this
surpringsingly easy.</p>
<p>This results in executing less JavaScript code but it also solves another very
common problem: too many <strong>http requests</strong>.</p>
<p>So its a good idea in general to only render and show the code the user needs to
interact with your React app initially, instead of just rendering everything.</p>
<h3><a name="code-coverage"></a> code-coverage</h3>
<p>Chrome offers the opportunity to detect <strong>unused</strong> code in your application.</p>
<p>The code coverage tab is located in the Chrome DevTools. You can find it in the
command menu when you type <em>coverage</em>.</p>
<p>It can track a whole reload of your application and is still tracking and
updating the code coverage when you&#x27;re interacting with your application.</p>
<p><img src="/images/coverage.jpeg" alt="a screenshot of the chrome coverage tool"/></p>
<p>This is another super easy quick win, which can help you to improve your
performance by removing <strong>unused code</strong>.</p>
<h3><a name="code-splitting"></a> code-splitting</h3>
<p>In a large and complex react application code-splitting is possibly one of the
best ways to improve your performance.</p>
<p>The idea of code-splitting is to split your code in ways it is needed in your
application and therefore render only the code which is needed for the <strong>current
UI</strong>.</p>
<p>Imagine having a Landingpage and a page where you show some articles, let&#x27;s call
it blog. Does the blog need to download and execute code which is only needed on
the Landingpage? No!</p>
<p>So you can use clever tools, who are capable of detecting where your code is
actually needed and split it up. That&#x27;s code-splitting.</p>
<p>One of these clever tools is <strong>React.lazy</strong>. You can read and learn more about
it in the
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html#reactlazy">React docs code splitting section <span> ↗</span></a>.
Please note that React.lazy is not available for server-side-rendering.
Code-splitting in a server rendered app can be achieved with
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://loadable-components.com/docs/server-side-rendering/">Loadable Components <span> ↗</span></a>.</p>
<h3><a name="react-profiler"></a> React Profiler</h3>
<p>The
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/09/10/introducing-the-react-profiler.html">React Profiler <span> ↗</span></a>
is another useful tool to gain more insight about what your React app is doing
and why. It is part of the React Browser Plugin and can be located in the
DevTools.</p>
<p>When you <strong>profile</strong> your app it collects timing information about each
component that is rendered. It also shows how long a specific component took to
render, if it needed to be updated and so on.</p>
<p>So you can either see if a component took way to long to render or identify
unecessary rerenders. Both are ways which can help you to identify performance
bottlenecks.</p>
<h3><a name="chrome-performance-analyzer"></a> Chrome Performance Analyzer</h3>
<p>Another way to collect information about your performance is the Chrome
Performance Analyzer. It&#x27;s also located in the Chrome DevTools and lets you
record the load performance of your app. This is the place where you analyze
your loading time in to the deepest. It just has so many options.</p>
<p>Take your time to read through the
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/evaluate-performance/reference">documentation of this performance evaluation tool <span> ↗</span></a>.</p>
<p>It makes sense to spent more time to fully understand what this tool is capable
of. It can totally help you boost your performance because it shows you
everything that&#x27;s happening with your JavaScript.</p>
<h3><a name="bundle-analyzer"></a> Bundle-Analyzer</h3>
<p>The
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-bundle-analyzer">Webpack Bundle Analyzer <span> ↗</span></a>
is a npm package which &quot;visualizes the size of webpack output files with an
interactive zoomable treemap&quot;. To use this package your application has to use
webpack for the bundling of course.</p>
<p>This Analyzer is such a great tool. It shows you exactly what files you give out
to your users, how big they are and also which files should absolutely not be in
your bundle.</p>
<p>In case of the large and complex web app I was working on, by using this
analyzer we realized that some packages where depending on the whole <code>lodash</code>
library which is a lot to include in to your bundle if you actually just need
one functionality of it.</p>
<h2><a name="conclusion"></a> Conclusion</h2>
<p>All these steps are great and helpful ways to find out why your React
application is slow and how to change that. You don&#x27;t have to implement all of
them, maybe already one of them will help you speed up things. I hope you could
learn something here and if you know more ways to boost the performance let me
know!</p>

<h3><a name="how-does-react-work"></a> How does React work?</h3>
<p>With React you can build <strong>interactive</strong> user interfaces, which get easily updated when the data changes. Dealing with data changes and DOM manipulation can be slow and unnecessary.</p>
<p>In React for every DOM object there is a <strong>virtual</strong> DOM object (like a lightweight copy). So React creates a virtual DOM. When state changes in a component it firstly runs a <em>&quot;diffing&quot;</em> algorithm, which identifies what has changed in the virtual DOM. The second step is reconcilitation, where it updates the DOM with the results of diff.</p>
<ul>
<li>When a JSX element is rendered, every virtual DOM element is <strong>updated</strong>.</li>
<li>React then compares the virtual DOM with a <strong>snapshot</strong> that was taken right before the update.</li>
<li>By doing this, React figures out exactly which virtual DOM objects have <strong>changed</strong> (diffing)</li>
<li>Then React <strong>updates</strong> only thos real DOM objects that have changed.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="jsx"></a> What is JSX?</h3>
<p>JSX is a <strong>syntax extension</strong> for JavaScript and was written to be used in React to describe what the UI should look like. It is <strong>not valid</strong> JavaScript, Web browsers can&#x27;t read it. It needs to be <strong>compiled</strong> (with Babel). Every HTML in a JavaScript file is called a JSX element.
JSX elements are like JS expressions, they can be:</p>
<ul>
<li>saved in a variable</li>
<li>passed into a function</li>
<li>stored in an array or an object</li>
</ul>
<p>They can have attributes like HTML elements, they can be nested (if they take up more than one line they must be wrapped in paranthesis) andthey must have at least one outermost element. In JSX HTML class get replaced by className. JS in JSX in JS is possible by wrapping content in <code>{...}</code></p>
<h3><a name="react-components"></a> React Components</h3>
<p>A React component is a small, <strong>resuable</strong> chunk of code, responsible for <strong>one job</strong> (e.g. render some HTML). The name of a component hast to start with a capital letter.</p>
<p>Components render other components (like a page renders a nav bar). To use a component from another file you need to import the file. You can also pass information to a component.</p>
<p>There are several ways to define a component. One is to use a JavaScript Function, another one is to use an ES6 class.</p>
<h3><a name="props"></a> What are Props?</h3>
<p>Props (short for properties) are a way of passing <strong>data/information</strong> from the parent to the child. Props are for <strong>static</strong> data and you can access the props with this.props. It is possible to declare default Props (for the case that no props are available).</p>
<p>A Component can not change their props. Props do not have to just be data. Callback functions my be passed in as props.</p>
<h3><a name="state"></a> What is State?</h3>
<p>State is data which is <strong>changing over time</strong>. State is reserved for <strong>interactivity</strong> and is <strong>private</strong> and fully controlled by a component. State can be updated asynchronously. A parent component can pass its state <strong>down</strong> to a child as props. As soon as the state changes a <strong>rerender</strong> is triggered.</p>
<h3><a name="conditional-rendering"></a> How does conditional rendering in React work?</h3>
<p>Conditional rendering in React works the same way as ins Vanilla JavaScript, so it is possible to use JS operators to create elements representing the current state and let React update the UI to match them. This means you can render only some items depending of the state of your application.</p>
<h3><a name="events"></a> How are events handled in React?</h3>
<p>To handle events in React, you have to add an event listener to an element. (difference to HTML: must be in lowerCamelCase e.g. onClick instead of onclick)</p>
<p>Event listeners are provided when the element is initially rendered, so there is no need to call <code>addEventListener</code>. The event listener gets passed in an event handler as props. Naming convention: start with handle, e.g. handleClick.</p>
<h3><a name="controlled-vs-uncontrolled"></a> Controlled Components vs Uncontrolled Components</h3>
<p>An input element whos value is controlled by React is called a <strong>controlled component</strong>. In HTML forms maintain their <strong>own</strong> state and update it based on user input. In React, mutable state is kept in the state property of the component.</p>
<p>These two combined make React the &quot;single source of truth&quot;. Then the React component that renders a form also <strong>controls</strong> what happens in that form on subsequent user input, so you write an event handler for every state update.</p>
<p>The alternative to controlled components are <strong>uncontrolled components</strong>, where form data is handled by the DOM itself.</p>
<h3><a name="default-props"></a> What are defaultProps?</h3>
<p>It is possible to define <strong>default values</strong> for component props. They are defined as a <strong>property</strong> on the component.</p>
<p>This is useful when you don&#x27;t get certain data, which you normally pass in props. Then you can fallback to the props, which you defined as the default.</p>
<h3><a name="proptypes"></a> What are PropTypes?</h3>
<p>With PropTypes you can check the <strong>type</strong> of a prop on a component. This means you can say you only accept a prop, when it has the type of a string. You can also flag props as <strong>required</strong> and set defaults as described above.</p>
<h3><a name="context"></a> What is context?</h3>
<p>Context provides a way to <strong>share data</strong> between components without having to pass props down manually at every level. This means, Context lets you pass a value deep into the component tree without explicitly threading it through every component.</p>
<p>But keep in mind, that Context should not be used only to avoid <strong>props drilling</strong>. The best use case for it is when a lot of components need to access the same prop.</p>
<p>Context ist defined with <code>React.createContext</code>. You have to use a <strong>Provider</strong> to pass the current context to the tree below. Then you have to use a <strong>Consumer</strong> to read the current context, React will find the closest Provider and use its value.</p>
<h3><a name=""></a> What are children?</h3>
<p>You can use children on components that represent generic boxes and don&#x27;t know their children ahead of time. It is used to display whatever you include between the opening and closing tags when invoking a component.</p>
<h3><a name="hoc"></a> What are higher-order-components?</h3>
<p>A higher-order component is a <strong>function</strong> that takes a component and <strong>returns</strong> a <strong>new component</strong>. It is also a wrapper for the old component. It is not part of the React API per se.</p>
<h3><a name="redux"></a> What is Redux?</h3>
<p>Redux is an <strong>advanced</strong> topic and not part of React. It is an <strong>additional</strong> library which comes in handy for problems, React does not solve properly for some developers.</p>
<p>Redux give you a <strong>global state container</strong>, the store. So you have one global state for your whole application and every component can access and update it by using <strong>actions</strong> and <strong>reducers</strong>.</p>
<p>You can trigger an action inside of your component. The reducer always <strong>listen</strong> for specific actions and then talk to the <strong>store</strong> and return the updated state.</p>
<h3>Sources &amp; Further Reading</h3>
<p>React has one of the best documentations I have ever used. I regularly head over to there, to fresh up my knowledge. It is written very well and has a lot of useful examples in it.</p>

<h3><a name="setup"></a>General setup and basics of CSS Grid development</h3>
<p>In the first few videos Wes talks about the <strong>tooling setup</strong> for the course. He
uses <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://browsersync.io/">browsersync <span> ↗</span></a> for the local development which is
an npm package, that automatically updates your browsers once you change the
HTML, CSS, images or other project files.</p>
<p>It is such a great tool I couldn&#x27;t work without and that is why browsersync has
had its safe spot in my build tool setup with gulp for a long time.</p>
<p>Wes also talks about the basics of CSS Grid development with the <strong>firefox
developer tools</strong>. The basic principle reminds of flexbox. You always have a
parent where you set <code>display: grid</code> and define the settings for columns, rows
and the gap between them.</p>
<p>Child elements inside this parent can be positioned separately. The firefox dev
tools have a special layout window included, where you can highlight the grid
view and also show the numbers of the grid cells which is extremely helpful when
developing CSS Grid.</p>
<h3><a name="implicit-vs-explicit"></a> Implicit vs. explicit Grid</h3>
<p>The difference between explicit and implicit grid tracks is simple. When you
explicitily define grid columns with <code>grid-template-columns: 100px 100px</code> you
get <strong>explicit</strong> grid tracks.</p>
<p>If the browser notices that there is not enough space for all your items he
automatically creates a second row.</p>
<p>So these tracks are called <strong>implicit</strong> because they are created by the browser
and not explicitely by you.</p>
<p>The same applies if you have four items and define two rows. If you now add two
more items, a new row is implicitly created by the browser. With
<code>grid-auto-rows</code> and <code>grid-auto-columns</code> you can style any implicitely created
row or column.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://codepen.io/Mkuehb/pen/rJoXxY">CodePen: CSS Grid - Implicit vs. Explicit Tracks <span> ↗</span></a></p>
<h3><a name="grid-auto-flow"></a> Grid-auto-flow</h3>
<p>If you have two items, define two columns using
<code>grid-template-columns: 200px 400px</code> and than add a third item, the browser will
put this item automatically in a new row below like described before with
implicit tracks.</p>
<p>This means <code>grid-auto-flow</code> is set to row by default. If yout set
<code>grid-auto-row</code> to <code>column</code> the third item will be put next to the already
available items into a new column automatically.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://codepen.io/Mkuehb/pen/wyNjJK">CodePen: CSS Grid - grid-auto-flow <span> ↗</span></a></p>
<h3><a name="sizing-tracks"></a> Sizing tracks</h3>
<p>The <code>fr</code> unit represents the amount of space left after all elements are laid
out.</p>
<p>If you define three columns with <code>grid-template-columns: 200px 200px 1fr</code> , the
first two columns will be 200px wide and the last one will take all the space
that is left.</p>
<p><code>fr</code> stands for <strong>fractional unit</strong> but Wes likes to call if free space which
helps with remembering the idea of the fr unit.</p>
<p>It is also possible to use the auto keyword. Then an item will be sized
according to the content it contains.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://codepen.io/Mkuehb/pen/ddaKbb">CodePen: CSS Grid - sizing tracks <span> ↗</span></a></p>
<h3><a name="repeat-function"></a> Repeat function</h3>
<p>Instead of writing:</p>
<pre class="mb-12"><code class="hljs language-css"><span class="hljs-attribute">grid-template-columns</span>: <span class="hljs-number">1</span>fr <span class="hljs-number">1</span>fr <span class="hljs-number">1</span>fr <span class="hljs-number">1</span>fr;
</code></pre>
<p>you can simply use the CSS Grid repeat function and write:</p>
<pre class="mb-12"><code class="hljs language-css"><span class="hljs-attribute">grid-template-columns</span>: <span class="hljs-built_in">repeat</span>(<span class="hljs-number">4</span>, <span class="hljs-number">1</span>fr);
</code></pre>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://codepen.io/Mkuehb/pen/vdbVeX">CodePen: CSS Grid - repeat function <span> ↗</span></a></p>
<h3><a name="sizing-grid-items"></a> Sizing Grid Items</h3>
<p>By default grid items just flow one after another and as there is space for each
one they will fit themselves into the grid as they can.</p>
<p>There is also a way to size grid items inside a parent grid container more
precisely. The instruction <code>grid-column: span 2</code> tells the browser to size the
specific child element with the space and width of two columns. The same goes
for <code>grid-row: span 2</code>.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://codepen.io/Mkuehb/pen/zWOYge">CodePen: CSS Grid - sizing grid items <span> ↗</span></a></p>
<h3><a name="placing-grid-items"></a> Placing Grid Items</h3>
<p>There are also better ways to position grid items than just sizing them. With
<code>grid-column-start</code> and <code>grid-column-end</code> you can define where a grid item
should start and where it should end. There is also a shortcut property for this
so with <code>grid-column: 2 / 5</code> the grid item starts with the second column and
ends before the fifth.</p>
<p>You can also define that the grid item should start at the first column and span
over two columns with <code>grid-column: 1 / span 2</code>.</p>
<p>If you want your grid item to start at the first column and span over the last,
but you don&#x27;t know how many columns you have, just use <code>grid-column: 1 / -1</code>.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://codepen.io/Mkuehb/pen/BrByaZ">CodePen: CSS Grid - Placing Grid Items <span> ↗</span></a></p>
<p>The second CodePen example below shows all the different ways to place grid
items inside a grid container. Have a look into the CSS to check how it is done.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://codepen.io/Mkuehb/pen/oqvjOv">CodePen: CSS Grid - Spanning and Placing Cardio <span> ↗</span></a></p>
<h3><a name="auto-fit-auto-fill"></a> auto-fit and auto-fill</h3>
<p>With the <code>auto-fill</code> expression inside the <code>grid-template-columns</code> declaration
you can tell the browser &quot;hmm I&#x27;m not sure how much columns I want just make
each 150px wide for example and then fill it with as many columns as possible&quot;.</p>
<p>So <code>grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, 150px);</code> does that.</p>
<p>The difference between <code>auto-fill</code> and <code>auto-fit</code> is visible when you have not
enough items to fill the grid.</p>
<p>With <code>auto-fill</code> the grid will create es many columns as possible altough you
don&#x27;t have enough items. So if you have four items and there is space for six,
the explicit grid ends after six items. In comparison to that <code>auto-fit</code> ends
the grid when all available items are placed inside your grid.</p>
<p>In the CodePen example below open the firefox dev tools, enable the grid view in
the layout window and you will see the difference between <code>auto-fit</code> and
<code>auto-fill</code>.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://codepen.io/Mkuehb/pen/BrayPm">CodePen: CSS Grid - auto-fill &amp; auto-fit <span> ↗</span></a></p>
<h3><a name="minmax"></a> Using minmax for responsive grids</h3>
<p>With <code>minmax()</code> you can tell the browser to make the items in a column a minimum
width of <code>150px</code> and a maximum width of <code>1fr</code> for example. So the items will
automatically adapt to the available space.</p>
<p>This is also a great way to create a responsive grid without media querries.</p>
<p>When the grid items have already the minimum width declared with <code>minmax()</code> and
the browser window gets smaller, they will automatically jump into the next row.</p>
<p>The CodePen example below also shows the difference between <code>auto-fit</code> and
<code>auto-fill</code> in combination with <code>minmax()</code>.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://codepen.io/Mkuehb/pen/jzOPzg">CodePen: CSS Grid - Using minmax() for Responsive Layouts <span> ↗</span></a></p>
<h3><a name="template-areas"></a> Grid template areas</h3>
<p>Grid Template areas come in handy for building a whole layout of a page. Say you
want to have two sidebars left and right and a content place between. Below you
want to have the footer spanning over the whole row.</p>
<p>With grid template areas you can type on your grid parent into the
<code>grid-template-areas</code> instruction exactly how you want the layout to look.</p>
<p>On the grid items, meaning the child items of the parent, you then tell each
item with <code>grid-area</code> which part of the layout it sould be. That&#x27;s it! Simple
and easy full page layout.</p>
<p>The firefox dev tools also offer the possibility to display your grid area names
so you can quickly check, if your layout is displayed as you wish it to be.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://codepen.io/Mkuehb/pen/GxRjdW">CodePen: CSS Grid - Grid Template Areas <span> ↗</span></a></p>
<h3><a name="naming-lines"></a> Naming lines in CSS Grid</h3>
<p>By default you declare to span your grid items over the columns and rows by
using the line names 1,2,3 and so on. CSS Grid offers also the possibility to
rename your line names on the <code>grid-template-columns</code> and <code>grid-template-rows</code>
declaration on the parent.</p>
<p>So if your initial declaration for the columns and the rows on the grid
container is like this:</p>
<pre class="mb-12"><code class="hljs language-css"><span class="hljs-attribute">grid-template-columns</span>: <span class="hljs-number">1</span>fr <span class="hljs-number">500px</span> <span class="hljs-number">1</span>fr;
<span class="hljs-attribute">grid-template-rows</span>: <span class="hljs-built_in">repeat</span>(<span class="hljs-number">10</span>, auto);
</code></pre>
<p>and you want to span an item inside the middle column from top to the tenth line
you would say:</p>
<pre class="mb-12"><code class="hljs language-css"><span class="hljs-attribute">grid-column</span>: <span class="hljs-number">2</span>;
<span class="hljs-attribute">grid-row</span>: <span class="hljs-number">2</span>/<span class="hljs-number">10</span>;
</code></pre>
<p>By renaming your columns and rows you can now position your item inside this
grid using the new line names.</p>
<pre class="mb-12"><code class="hljs language-css"><span class="hljs-attribute">grid-template-columns</span>:
  [site-left] <span class="hljs-number">1</span>fr [content-start] <span class="hljs-number">500px</span> [content-end] <span class="hljs-number">1</span>fr [site-right];
<span class="hljs-attribute">grid-template-rows</span>:
  [content-top] <span class="hljs-built_in">repeat</span>(<span class="hljs-number">10</span>, auto) [content-bottom];
</code></pre>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://codepen.io/Mkuehb/pen/mxdQQN">CodePen: CSS Grid - Naming Lines in CSS Grid <span> ↗</span></a></p>
<h3><a name="block-fitting"></a> Grid-auto-flow dense block fitting</h3>
<p>Grid-auto-flow is by default set to row so every item, that does not fit in the
same row will automatically be put into a new row below. This can be helpful but
also not really useful in a lot of cases.</p>
<p>If you have a grid with ten columns and you want every sixth item to span over
six columns there will be a lot of empty space because the six column long item
often can&#x27;t fit in the same row and is put into the next row via
<code>grid-auto-flow: row</code> and the space left over is not filled with other items.</p>
<p>In this cases the dense value comes to help.
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid-auto-flow">MDN <span> ↗</span></a> describes
this value as following:</p>
<p>Dense</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;is a keyword specifying that the auto-placement algorithm uses a &#x27;dense&#x27;
packing algorithm, which attempts to fill in holes earlier in the grid, if
smaller items come up later. This may cause items to appear out-of-order, when
doing so would fill in holes left by larger items&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Go ahead and turn the <code>grid-auto-flow: dense</code> instruction on and off in the
CodePen example below to see the difference.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://codepen.io/Mkuehb/pen/wmMKxY">CodePen: CSS Grid - grid-auto-flow block formatting <span> ↗</span></a></p>
<h3><a name="alignment-and-centering"></a> CSS Grid alignment + centering</h3>
<p>Flexbox made centering items on a page really easy. CSS Grid also has its ways
to center items without problems.</p>
<p>There are two main properties which can be used for that. Justify-_ defines
everything on the row axis and align-_ defines everything on the column axis.</p>
<p>With <code>justify-items</code> and <code>align-items</code> you can define the alignment for your
grid items on the grid container. There is also a shorthand called <code>place-items</code>
which you can give two values, the first for the justify-_ property and the
second for the align-_ property.</p>
<p>If your grid items don&#x27;t fill up your whole grid you can use <code>justify-content</code>
and <code>align-content</code> to align them as one inside your grid container.</p>
<p>Finally with <code>justify-self</code> and <code>align-self</code> you can overwrite the alignment
settings on the container and specify them on a single grid item.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://codepen.io/Mkuehb/pen/GxoqOy">CodePen: CSS Grid - Alignment and Centering <span> ↗</span></a></p>
<h3><a name="re-ordering"></a> Re-ordering Grid items</h3>
<p>Imagine having a ten column wide grid with a logo on the left that spans over 2
columns, a nav on the right that spans over 8 columns and a full width content
below.</p>
<p>It is possible to change the order of the logo and the nav easily so that the
logo will be on the right and the nav on the left.</p>
<p>By default every item has the value of 0 on the order property. So giving the
nav <code>order: 0</code>, the logo <code>order: 1</code> and the content <code>order: 3</code> will achieve the
re-ordering.</p>
<p>It is important to mention that this technique will goof up the order a
screenreader will read it so it is kind of bad practice concerning accessibility
if you use this on a bunch of paragraphs for example. But for a nav and a logo
it does not matter that much.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://codepen.io/Mkuehb/pen/GxojJY">CodePen: CSS Grid - Re-ordering Grid items <span> ↗</span></a></p>
<h2>Real World Examples</h2>
<h3><a name="album-layouts"></a> Nesting Grid with album layouts</h3>
<p>In this example you can see several album info boxes consisting of an image and
a few details about the album. To achieve this layout, you have to define the
columns on the main grid first, which contains every album info box.</p>
<p>With the following expression you can define a grid which has columns with a
minimum width of <code>400px</code> and a maximum width of <code>1fr</code>.</p>
<pre class="mb-12"><code class="hljs language-css"><span class="hljs-attribute">grid-template-columns</span>: <span class="hljs-built_in">repeat</span>(<span class="hljs-built_in">minmax</span>(<span class="hljs-number">400px</span>, <span class="hljs-number">1</span>fr));
</code></pre>
<p>So depending on the available space, the Grid will add columns or remove columns
and shrink or expand them accordingly, which creates a fully flexible and
responsive layout without media querries.</p>
<p>To achieve the layout inside the album info boxes it is important to know, that
grid items can also be grid containers like we know it from flexbox already.</p>
<p>So you can add two columns into every album info box so the album image has a
width of <code>150px</code> and the text takes all the remaining space. The vertical
alignment is also possible.</p>
<pre class="mb-12"><code class="hljs language-css"><span class="hljs-attribute">align-items</span>: center;
<span class="hljs-attribute">display</span>: grid;
<span class="hljs-attribute">grid-template-columns</span>: <span class="hljs-number">150px</span> <span class="hljs-number">1</span>fr;
</code></pre>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://codepen.io/Mkuehb/pen/jzqXVo">CodePen: CSS Grid - Nesting grid with album layouts <span> ↗</span></a></p>
<h3><a name="css-grid-image-gallery"></a> CSS Grid image gallery</h3>
<p>The next example is about building an image gallery with CSS Grid. The basic
grid for this consists of repeating columns and rows that are 100px wide and
high. This example is extened with a little bit of JavaScript to give each image
a different width and height.</p>
<p>Therefore you have to make an array with the length of 50. <code>Array.from</code> is
pretty useful in this case. Every Item of this array is an array itself
consisting of two random numbers between 1 and 4. This two values will describe
the horizontal and vertical length of the image.</p>
<p>For every item of the digits array you then have to build the HTML which
consists of the image, an overlay and a close button. By using ES6 destructuring
you can insert the randomly generated numbers for the horizontal and vertical
values and use them as CSS class names.</p>
<p>By doing that you will get 50 different images in the grid with a random row and
column span between 1 and 4. Using the dense value on the <code>grid-auto-flow</code>
property you can avoid having two many empty spots inbetween.</p>
<p>Another useful thing I learned here is, that by setting two grid items in the
same row and column, they will overlap. Very practical for adding overlay
elements.</p>
<h3><a name="flexbox-vs-grid"></a> Flexbox vs. CSS Grid</h3>
<p>In general CSS Grid can do everything Flexbox can do. Some people say that
Flexbox is for laying out elements in one dimension and CSS Grid is for laying
out elements in two dimensions.</p>
<p>In this example, Wes shows how things solved previously with flexbox can be done
with CSS Grid and in what scenarios Flexbox is still the winner. You can find
all the examples in the CodePen below.</p>

<p>In this example you are recreating CodePen, the tool I have used to display all
the examples before. CodePen is a development environment which allows you to
write code in the browser and see the results immediately.</p>
<p>This example is a good practice to learn to layout different sections of a page
with CSS Grid. Basically it is all about grids inside other grids.</p>

<h3><a name="bootstrappy-grid"></a> Bootstrappy Grid with CSS variables</h3>
<p>Bootstrap became very popular for implementing an easy way to use a responsive
grid on a website. It implemented CSS classes for the orientation of your
elements, how they should behave on different viewports and how far they would
span in your grid.</p>
<p>So a div with the class of col-sm-4 would span over 4 columns on a viewport that
is equal to or greater than 768px wide.</p>
<p>In this example Wes shows how to achieve the Bootstrap principle with CSS Grid.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://codepen.io/Mkuehb/pen/RMVPdj">CodePen: CSS Grid - Bootstrappy Grid with CSS Variables <span> ↗</span></a></p>
<h3><a name="responsive-website"></a> Responsive Website</h3>
<p>In this example Wes shows how to build a <strong>whole responsive</strong> website with <strong>CSS
Grid</strong>. He devides the page into several sections and then uses almost every
technique of CSS Grid learned in the course to layout the page.</p>
<p>Another thing Wes teaches here and I really liked is the usage of aria
attributes on buttons. Instead of adding and removing a CSS class on the button,
you can simply check the aria attributes value of the button and also use the
aria attributes value for styling.</p>
<p>In this example the button to open the navigation menu has the aria attribute
<code>aria-expanded=&quot;false&quot;</code> which indicates by default that the menu is not
expanded.</p>
<p>Additionally it has the aria attribute <code>aria-controls=&quot;menu-list&quot;</code> which
indicates, that the button controls the element with the class of menu-list
which is in this case the navigation.</p>
<p>By changing the values of this attributes with JavaScript, you can toggle the
menu easily.</p>

<h3><a name="blog-layout"></a> Full bleed blog layout</h3>
<p>The last example is about building a blog layout with sections of different
width and elements.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this blog post I answered the <strong>HTML Questions</strong> from the Frontend Developer Interview Questions. This is a GitHub repo which contains helpful lists of frontend related questions to test yourself or extend your knowledge.</p>

</ol>
<hr class="my-10"/>
<h3><a name="doctype"></a> What does a DOCTYPE do?</h3>
<p>The doctype makes sure the document gets parsed the same way by different browsers. It prevents the browser from switching into <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Quirks_Mode_and_Standards_Mode">&quot;quirks-mode&quot; <span> ↗</span></a> when rendering a document.</p>
<h3><a name="lng"></a>How do you serve a page with content in multiple languages?</h3>
<p>By using the lang attribute on the html element <code>lang=&quot;en&quot;</code>.</p>
<h3><a name="multilingual"></a>What kind of things must you be wary of when design or developing for multilingual sites?</h3>
<p>You have to enable an easy way for users to change their language. There is also the possibility that people from different countries need different content.</p>
<h3><a name="data-attributes"></a>What are data- attributes good for?</h3>
<p><code>data-</code> attributes ca be used to store extra information on standard, semantic HTML elements without using non-standard attributes.</p>
<h3><a name="html5"></a>Consider HTML5 as an open web platform. What are the building blocks of HTML5?</h3>
<p>MDN lists several groups which form the building blocks of HTML5 and contain many different technologies:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Semantics:</strong> allowing you to describe more precisely what your content is</li>
<li><strong>Connectivity:</strong> allowing you to communicate with the server in new and innovative ways</li>
<li><strong>Offline and storage:</strong> allowing webpages to store data on the client-side locally and operate offline more efficiently</li>
<li><strong>Multimedia:</strong> making video and audio first-class citizens in the Open Web</li>
<li><strong>2D/3D graphics and effects:</strong> allowing much more diverse range of presentation options</li>
<li><strong>Performance and Integration:</strong> providing greater speed optimization and better usage of computer hardware</li>
<li><strong>Device access:</strong> allowing for the usage of various input and output devices</li>
<li><strong>Styling:</strong> letting authors write more sophisticated themes</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="storage"></a>Describe the difference between a cookie, sessionStorage and localStorage.</h3>
<p>When using a <strong>Cookie</strong>, data is sent to the server and is primarly for server-side reading (but can also be read on the client side). The size must be less than 4KB.</p>
<p>When using <strong>sessionStorage</strong>, the data is stored in the browser and can only be read on the clientside. The stored data is only available for one session, so when the browser tab gets closed, the data gets deleted. The storage limit is larger than a Cookie (at least 5MB).</p>
<p>When using <strong>localStorage</strong>, the data gets also stored in the browser and can only be read on the clientside. But it has no expiration date and the storage limit is the maximum of the three.</p>
<h3><a name="scripts"></a>Describe the difference between script, script async and script defer.</h3>
<p>The regular <code>script</code> tag is used to embed or reference executable code and is typically used to embed or refer to JavaScript code. When the browser comes during the HTML parsing by a script tag it stops the rendering and executes the JavaScript tag.</p>
<p>Using the script async tag will not block the rendering, but will run the script as soon as it is downloaded and available.</p>
<p>The script defer tag will defer the script and run it after the page is done parsing.</p>
<h3><a name="link-and-script-positioning"></a> Why is it generally a good idea to position CSS links between head and JS scripts just before the body ends? Do you know any exceptions?</h3>
<p>The CSS link has to be positioned in the head so it is downloaded and the styling is available as fast as possible. If the css link is positioned inside the body it is possible that the page is displayed without CSS for a short periode of time. This is called FOUC (Flash of unstyled content).</p>
<p>It is also a good idea to put the JS script before the closing body tag. If you put the JS script tag in the head or before the actual HTML content in the body, the browser will stop the rendering and first download all the JS.</p>
<p>So it could be the case that the web page is only half visible for a short periode of time because the rendering is blocked to download the JavaScript first.</p>
<h3><a name="srcset"></a> Why you would use a srcset attribute in an image tag? Explain the process the browser uses when evaluating the content of this attribute.</h3>
<p>The <code>srcset</code> attribute is used to provide the same image in different versions, depending on the viewport. So you can display the image with different width and quality for mobile and different width and quality for desktop.</p>
<p>With the srcset attribute you will allow the browser to choose between, and what size each image is. First you have to insert the file name, a space followed by the image&#x27;s inherent width in pixels.</p>
<p>The additional attribute sizes adds a set of media queries and tells the browser what image size to choose when certain conditions are true. The sizes attribute contains the media condition (max-width: 680px), a space, followed by the width of the slot the image will fill when the media condition is true.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I just started the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://javascript30.com/">JavaScript30 Challenge <span> ↗</span></a> by
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://twitter.com/wesbos">Wes Bos <span> ↗</span></a> where you get to code <strong>30 different
projects</strong> and ideas with <strong>plain JavaScript</strong>.</p>
<p>No frameworks - no compilers - no libraries - no boilerplates.</p>
<p>The idea of JavaScript30 is either to code along as this is a video series or to
build it by yourself and compare it with Wes&#x27; solution at the end.</p>
<p>I think this is a great idea if you are like me, lacking of ideas for JS
projects, want to learn ES6 and level up your JS skills in general. The perfect
challenge for your daily dose of JavaScript.</p>
<p>To learn to most from it, I coded along or tried to solve it at my own and put
all of it on <strong>CodePen</strong>. You can check it out
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://codepen.io/collection/DapjRG">here <span> ↗</span></a>.</p>

<p>It&#x27;s free so enjoy it, have fun and don&#x27;t forget to thank Wes Bos! You can also
find a list of other peoples experiences and solutions on the GitHub repo:

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are a lot of great blogs, newsletters, tools, websites out there about
Fronted Development. In this blog post I&#x27;d like to present you my favorite
<strong>frontend links and bookmarks</strong> which I&#x27;m using daily or at least weekly.</p>
<p>I won&#x27;t categorize them, so this will not be a list of my favorite blogs only,
for example, or my favorite github projects. It will be more like the best
link-list (for me personally) of every category. Also the list itself will not
be in any ranking, I&#x27;ll just present them to you in a random order.</p>
<p>You&#x27;ll also be able to find my Frontend Bookmarks on

free to make <strong>suggestions</strong> to this list with your own favorite bookmarks and
links. One goal of this blog post will be to get my own list growing as I&#x27;m
always looking forward to find new blogs or newsletters about Frontend
Development. Enough with the introduction, let&#x27;s take a look at my Frontend

<h3><a name="mdn"></a> Mozilla Developer Network</h3>
<p>The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">Mozilla Developer Network <span> ↗</span></a> is my
number one visited website currently. It&#x27;s my central station. It&#x27;s not only the
biggest and best up to date <strong>documentation</strong> about <strong>web technologies</strong>, it
also offers awesome <strong>articles</strong> and <strong>guides</strong> to learn more about HTML, CSS,
JavaScript, DOM, Web APIs and many more.</p>
<p>I just use it for everything. I use it to look up CSS properties, learn more
about how certain JavaScript methods work and to find out what attributes belong
to a specific HTML element.</p>
<p>If I google a specific frontend problem I usually start with &quot;mdn ...&quot; because
I&#x27;ve always found a solution there. Mozilla recently started the
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Learn">Learning web development <span> ↗</span></a> section
which &quot;aims to provide complete beginners to web development with all they need
to start coding simple websites&quot;.</p>
<p>So if you get stuck anywhere, MDN always explains a solution, if you want to
learn more about CSS Layout, HTML audio and video or anything similar, MDN is
the place to go.</p>
<p>My <strong>favorite article</strong> on <strong>MDN</strong> is
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/A_re-introduction_to_JavaScript">A re-introduction to JavaScript <span> ↗</span></a>.
If you&#x27;re new to JavaScript or want to re-learn or look up the core concepts, I
highly recommend this article.</p>
<h3><a name="caniuse"></a> CanIUse</h3>
<p>Do your ask yourself daily &quot;Oh I want to use this new CSS property or this HTML
element, but does it work already in Internet Explorer, Opera or in any Android
Browser?&quot; If you&#x27;ve answered yes, I have a solution for you. The website
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="http://caniuse.com/">caniuse.com <span> ↗</span></a> does this job for you.</p>
<p>You just have to browse there, type in a property or element and CanIUse
provides you up-to-date <strong>browser support tables</strong> for support of front-end web
technologies on desktop and mobile web browsers.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s also separated by the different versions of every browser, shows the
current published version, browser usage and specific notes, known issues and
resources. So it&#x27;s not only showing you, which browser supports what, it is also
telling you, why one browser doesn&#x27;t support this specific CSS property yet.</p>
<p>Great tool I don&#x27;t want to miss! There is also a CanIUse Node.js module which
let&#x27;s you look up browser support from the command line.
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://twitter.com/davidwalshblog">David Walsh <span> ↗</span></a> wrote a small
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://davidwalsh.name/caniuse-command-line">blog post <span> ↗</span></a> about it.</p>
<h3><a name="pagespeed-insights"></a> PageSpeed Insights</h3>
<p><strong>PageSpeedInsights</strong> is a great tool I already mentioned and explained in my
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://marcoheine.com/blog/website-performance-optimization/">Website Performance Optimization blog post <span> ↗</span></a>
so I won&#x27;t talk that much about it here and just give a brief summary.</p>
<p>You just enter the URL of the website you&#x27;d like to test and PageSpeedInsights
loads the page on a small screen and on a big screen, analyzes <strong>what&#x27;s good and
what&#x27;s bad</strong> on the website and additionally gives very useful advice on how to
do better.</p>
<p>As I said I&#x27;ve explained this in depth in my blog post so I&#x27;d suggest you head
over there if you&#x27;re interested in learning more about PageSpeedInsights.</p>
<h3><a name="codepen"></a> CodePen</h3>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="http://codepen.io/">CodePen <span> ↗</span></a> quotes itself as a &quot;Playground for the front end
web&quot; and I think this describes it perfectly. In short, it&#x27;s a <strong>code editor in
the browser</strong>. You can quickly write HTML, CSS and JavaScript there and
immediately see the output.</p>
<p>It even got a console recently so it&#x27;s now also possible to debug JavaScript. I
often use it to quickly try out new HTML, CSS features or <strong>prototype something
really quickly</strong> because this is its biggest advantage: It&#x27;s fast and you get
the result immediately.</p>
<p>It gets new features and updates recently so you can not only play around with
simple HTML, CSS and JavaScript, you can also use HTML Preprocessors like Haml
or Markdown, CSS Preprocessors like Sass, integrate Normalize.css, add external
CSS, add popular JS libraries like jQuery or add external JS.</p>
<p>Another great thing I love about CodePen is its <strong>collaborative thinking</strong>. You
can share or work together on a &quot;Pen&quot; very easy, you can integrate a &quot;Pen&quot; into
your website like I did on this
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://marcoheine.com/blog/new-css-layout/">blog post <span> ↗</span></a> and you can browse Pens
of others to get inspired or learn something new. I love to browse on CodePen
daily and see everyday the impressive and amazing work of other developers.</p>

<p>I think I don&#x27;t have to write that much about <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://github.com/">GitHub <span> ↗</span></a>
here, it&#x27;s a very well known service and I guess every developer used it once or
at least heard of it. I think one of the best ways to learn to code is to look
at and inspect other peoples code and that&#x27;s what I love about GitHub.</p>
<p>You get the possibility to <strong>browse the code of your favorite libraries</strong>,
technologies and tools and get an insight of how these people build their
software. The other great opportunity GitHub features is, of course, OSS.</p>
<p>Everybody is encouraged to contribute to famous projects. I have to admit that I
did not dare to contribute a PR so far, but it&#x27;s definitely a big thing on my to
do list. I also really like the GitHub
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://github.com/explore">explore section <span> ↗</span></a> where you can find and browse new
projects.</p>
<h3><a name="css-tricks"></a> CSS-Tricks</h3>
<p>I guess I know about <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://css-tricks.com/">CSS-Tricks <span> ↗</span></a> since I made my first
real steps in web development back when I did my bachelors degree. Originally
its articles contained <strong>real CSS tricks</strong> but this changed so now it covers
tricks for almost every section in web development! I really like CSS-Tricks for
their <strong>great articles and tutorials</strong>. They are also the creators of
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="http://codepen.io/">CodePen <span> ↗</span></a>.</p>
<p>One of my favorite articles on CSS-Tricks is
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://css-tricks.com/front-end-development-is-development/">Front End Development is Development <span> ↗</span></a>
by Geoff Graham where he explains why some people argue that Front End
Development should not be considered &quot;real development&quot; and why this is just
wrong. It&#x27;s a great summary of all the aspects a Frontend Developer has to deal
with and it clearly shows that we are &quot;real&quot; developers.</p>
<p>Another article, which I think is really one of the best on CSS-Tricks, was
recently published by Chris Coyier and is called
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://css-tricks.com/front-end-developer-aware/">A Front End Developer is Aware <span> ↗</span></a>.
It just starts off, where the other article stopped and explains the position of
a Frontend Developer and why we have to be aware of everything.</p>
<p>&quot;In a general sense, the front end developer is positioned in the middle of lots
of other jobs. Everybody involved in a web team ends up talking with the front
end developers. That makes sense. The front end developers create the actual
thing people interact with. Everything comes together with the front end
developer.</p>
<p>Perhaps that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s such a fun job! Because the front end developer is this
central hub position and dealing with lots of different people doing lots of
different jobs, the job can be done better if they are aware. Aware of
everything else that makes a website tick.&quot;</p>
<p>I really recommend reading this article and again that&#x27;s exactly what I like so
much about CSS-Tricks.</p>
<h3><a name="smashing-magazine"></a> Smashing Magazine</h3>
<p>When I wanted to discover more web development resources,
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/">Smashing-Magazine <span> ↗</span></a> wasn&#x27;t really hard to
find. It&#x27;s one of the <strong>biggest</strong> and <strong>most important blogs</strong> about frontend
development and in my opinion it&#x27;s a place where the best and most researched
articles are published.</p>
<p>Compared to other blogs its articles are not short posts or tutorials - they
usually dig a lot <strong>deeper</strong> and explain further contexts. Next to their well
researched articles Smashing Mag also publishes the
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/printed-books/smashing-book-5/">Smashing Book <span> ↗</span></a>.</p>
<p>The latest published book, Smashing Book 5, is about &quot;Real-Life Responsive Web
Design&quot; and I highly recommend it. It covers various topics concerning
Responsive Web Design like Responsive Workflow, Design Patterns and Components,
SVG, Flexbox, Testing and Debugging and many more.</p>
<p>On top of that, Smashing Mag organizes a great series of <strong>conferences</strong>: the
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="http://smashingconf.com/">Smashing Conference <span> ↗</span></a>. I wasn&#x27;t able to attend one so
far but it&#x27;s definitely on my to do list.</p>
<h3><a name="reddit"></a> Reddit JavaScript &amp; Learn JavaScript</h3>
<p>Of Course you have heard of <strong>reddit</strong>, the &quot;front page of the internet&quot;. I use
a lot of subreddits and for that reason I really like the
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/">JavaScript <span> ↗</span></a> and
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJavaScript">Learn JavaScript <span> ↗</span></a> subreddits.</p>
<p>I try to check them out daily because you&#x27;ll always find interesting <strong>links,
projects or tools</strong> there or learn something new. Additionally a lot of people
present their projects there attached to some problems they would like to
overcome and it&#x27;s really fun to read these stories and help them trying to
figure out a solution.</p>
<p>So the JavaScript and Learn JavaScript Reddit pages are great places to get your
<strong>daily dose of JavaScript</strong>. If you&#x27;re interested in more JavaScript links,
especially focused on learning I&#x27;d like to point you to my
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://github.com/marcoheine-com/javascript-learning-resources">JavaScript learning resources <span> ↗</span></a>
GitHub repository at this point. I think it&#x27;s a great collection of resources
I&#x27;ve used and am using right now to dig deeper into JavaScript.</p>
<h3><a name="newsletter"></a> Newsletter</h3>
<p>Besides online documentation, blogs or tools for frontend development I&#x27;m a big
fan of <strong>newsletters</strong>. I really like the idea that someone sends me an awesome
list weekly, where he or she carefully collected the best and most informative
links of the week about any frontend development topic.</p>
<p>Sometimes I already got across the most links but this doesn&#x27;t matter, mostly
there is always something <strong>new to learn</strong> and <strong>discover</strong>. So far I&#x27;m
regularly reading the following three newsletters:</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="http://javascriptweekly.com/">JavaScript Weekly <span> ↗</span></a> which is obviously all about
JavaScript, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="http://html5weekly.com/">Frontend Focus <span> ↗</span></a>, formerly HTML5 weekly,
which is more like a web platform technology roundup and last but not least the
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://wdrl.info/">Web Development Reading List <span> ↗</span></a>. This one is also published
on the Smashing Magazine website.</p>
<p>What I really like about this newsletter is, that&#x27;s it is seperated in different
sections like concept &amp; design, tools &amp; workflows, privacy, javascript, css/sass
and many more.</p>
<h3><a name="conclusion"></a> Conclusion</h3>
<p>So this is it - these are my <strong>favorite frontend bookmarks</strong>, as I explained at
the beginning: in a complete random order and without categorization. It&#x27;s not a
big list and I definitely want it to <strong>grow</strong>!</p>
<p>So if you&#x27;ve got any link to a blog, tool, newsletter, project etc. concerning
frontend development, I&#x27;d love to check it out and add it to my collection. Feel
free to drop me an email or directly contribute on
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://github.com/marcoheine-com/frontend-bookmarks">GitHub <span> ↗</span></a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

call me a Junior Developer. Though I remember times where I built Websites with
table Layout. It was for several university projects.</p>
<p>I looked back into the code and noticed that I was using a little position
absolute &amp; relative here and there but built the main layout of the page with
tables. Yikes!</p>

<h3><a name="introduction"></a>Introduction - My Journey with CSS Layout</h3>
<p>I guess I never heard of semantics these days. All I cared about was, that it
worked. Somehow. After that I also learned about positioning with floats. But it
never felt right for me. I managed to use kind of a combination of floats,
display properties and absolute/relative positioning.</p>
<p>But CSS layout felt always strange for me, I never got behind the real concepts
of it. It always felt like one big hack. This all changed when I first heard
about Flexbox.</p>
<h3><a name="flexbox-whats-that"></a>Flexbox - what&#x27;s that?</h3>
<p>When I first learned about Flexbox, I was astonished.</p>
<p>I can position two elements next two each other, without the need of clearing
floats?</p>
<p>I can position an element wherever I want it to be and even change the flowing
directions or what happens, when the window shrinks?</p>
<p>I can center elements both, horizontally AND vertically?</p>
<p>Okay, wow. So much cool stuff that was possible now without any weird feeling
fix or hack to make it work.</p>
<p>Flexbox stands for Flexible Box and the main concepts consists of different
properties which allow it to arrange elements on a page such that they behave
predictably when the page layout shrinks, grows or changes in another way due to
different screen sizes or display devices.</p>
<p>You can read more about the concept behind Flexbox on the
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Using_CSS_flexible_boxes">MDN Documentation <span> ↗</span></a>.
Sure it took its time until Flexbox got wide browser support but now it&#x27;s up to
94% of global browser support. For comparison browser-radius only got 90% global
support.</p>
<p>To gain more attention for Flexbox, a lot of smart people made tools to help
others learn the main concepts of Flexbox really fast. My favorite two are
Flexbox <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="http://flexboxfroggy.com/">Froggy <span> ↗</span></a> and
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="http://www.flexboxdefense.com/">Flexbox Defense <span> ↗</span></a>. The first one lets you use
the different Flexbox properties to guide Frogs to their lilypads. The second
one uses Flexbox to position Towers all over a game court and destroy the
incoming enemies with the help of these towsers.</p>
<p>If you haven&#x27;t tried them out yet, don&#x27;t hesitate to do it now! If you are not
into Gamification there is also a
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://egghead.io/lessons/misc-flexbox-fundamentals">great video <span> ↗</span></a> by Joe
Maddalone for egghead where he explains all Flexbox properties in ten minutes.</p>
<p>I also tried to contribute to the Flexbox learning movement. I made a small
Flexbox playground where you can see all the Flexbox properties in action. You
can switch between the different properties and immediately see their impacts
and changes on the page layout.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://codepen.io/Mkuehb/pen/KzrqBY">Flexbox Playground on CodePen <span> ↗</span></a></p>
<p>I won&#x27;t get into all the Flexbox properties in this blog post, there are other
great resources which explain all about Flexbox very well, like the Complete
Guide to Flexbox by Chris Coyier on
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/">CSS-Tricks <span> ↗</span></a>. This
guide explains every Flexbox property in depth and covers every single thing you
need to know to work with Flexbox.</p>
<h3><a name="flexbox-dont-use-it-for-everything"></a>Flexbox - don&#x27;t use it for everything</h3>
<p>For the first time working on a CSS Layout feels right for me, thanks a lot to
Flexbox. It&#x27;s great to make simple layouts for small, responsive websites. I
also used it in most cases on my own website. But it also has its pitfalls and
weaknesses. Therefore it&#x27;s kinda hard to use Flexbox to built complex website
layouts.</p>
<p>Of course it&#x27;s possible and I&#x27;ve seen a lot of tutorials showing you how to
build a mulitcolumn or a holy-grail layout with flexbox. But it&#x27;s not meant for
that. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://twitter.com/jaffathecake">Jake Archibald <span> ↗</span></a> explains why Flexbox
shouldn&#x27;t be used for page layout in this
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://jakearchibald.com/2014/dont-use-flexbox-for-page-layout/">blog post <span> ↗</span></a>.
The best use cases for Flexbox are laying out small interface components like
form elements, the links in a menu, everything that&#x27;s in a single dimension, in
a row or a column.</p>
<p>&quot;But you were so happy and confident about this new CSS layout method and now
you say I should not use it for my overall page layout? I&#x27;m confused now!&quot;</p>
<p>Sorry for that but there is another technology that will satisfy all of your
needs, soon. It&#x27;s called CSS Grid Layout.</p>
<h3><a name="css-grid-layout"></a>CSS Grid Layout</h3>
<p>While Flexbox has been designed to layout individual components and their chunks
of content, CSS Grid Layout is perfectly for overall page layout.</p>
<p>&quot;CSS Grid Layout (aka &quot;Grid&quot;), is a two-dimensional grid-based layout system
that aims to do nothing less than completely change the way we design grid-based
user interfaces.&quot; says Chris House in this amazing
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/">complete guide to grid <span> ↗</span></a>.</p>
<p>The big problem: global browser support is now at
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="http://caniuse.com/#search=grid">8.1% <span> ↗</span></a>. It&#x27;s currently a
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-grid-1/">W3C Working Draft <span> ↗</span></a> and it&#x27;s only usable with
the experimental flag enabled in google chrome. But it will be only a matter of
time until CSS Grid will redefine the way we layout websites with CSS.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://codepen.io/Mkuehb/pen/EKrNMp">CSS Grid Layout on CodePen <span> ↗</span></a></p>
<p>I won&#x27;t get any deeper into all the properties of the CSS Grid Layout. There are
some awesome guides out there, which will explain anything you need to know like
the one from CSS-Tricks I mentioned before.</p>
<p>Another great person you will definitely come across when dealing with CSS Grid
is
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://twitter.com/rachelandrew?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor">Rachel Andrew <span> ↗</span></a>.
She held some great talks about CSS Grid Layout and works hard to teach people
more about this new technology everday and gain more support for it.</p>
<p>She is also the author and owner of
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://gridbyexample.com/">gridbyexample.com <span> ↗</span></a> where she explains everything
that exists about CSS Grid Layout. It&#x27;s one big collection of links to articles,
videos and code examples so if you&#x27;re willing to learn more about this topic,
this is the right place to start.</p>
<h3><a name="conclusion"></a> Conclusion</h3>
<p>I think CSS Grid Layout is great and in combination with Flexbox it seems to
change the way how we create our layouts with CSS completely. After a long
journey with techniques that weren&#x27;t originally ment for page layout like tables
and floats – which felt (for me personally) always like hacking and trying to
fix it somehow so it works and breaks nothing – a new layout method has emerged
and I&#x27;m really looking forward to it. I hope till the end of 2016 it will be
ready to be used in production so we can establish finally a CSS layout method
which is absolutely meant for this job.</p>

<h3><a name="why-performance-matters"></a>Why Performance Matters</h3>
<p>I don&#x27;t want to wait up until 4 or 5 seconds for the website to load. I want to
see my results immediatly and if that&#x27;s not going to happen I&#x27;m looking further
even if that website I just closed would have had the perfect answer to my
google search query.</p>
<p>This is why Website Performance and Speed matters to me and why I&#x27;m trying to
improve these aspects on every website I&#x27;m working on. But am I the only one,
used to this behaviour, not wanting to wait longer than a few seconds for a
website to load?</p>

The most interesting fact in my opinion is, that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;If a page load takes more than two seconds, 40% are likely to abandon that
site&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can find the sources to all facts on the link above. His Conclusion is that
&quot;speed matters online&quot; and &quot;even 100 millisecond delays in load times negatively
impact user experience and conversions&quot;.</p>

difference. After a &quot;reboot&quot;

The reasons for very slow loading times in the first place where mainly a lot of
calls to the server for ad tags, features and additionally the GQ website was
published on multiple CMS.</p>
<p>So they reduced their calls to the server by 400%, migrated to a single CMS,
decluttered the entire website and cut the page load time by 80%, so now it
loads in under two seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> I&#x27;m not saying, that I&#x27;m already an expert in optimizing performance
and page speed and because of that I&#x27;m gathering a few methods here to learn
even more about these topics for myself.</p>
<h3><a name="where-to-start"></a>Where to start</h3>
<p>While I&#x27;m working on a project or if I want to test a website which I find
interesting, the first thing I usually do is heading over to
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/">Googles PageSpeed Insights <span> ↗</span></a>.
With this tool you can test your website twice for efficiency: on mobile and on
desktop.</p>
<p>PageSpeed Insights captures the time your website needs to load the content
&quot;above the fold&quot; and the time for loading the whole content. Additionally it
tests your website on user experience and in the end you&#x27;ll get a rating between
0 and 100.</p>
<p>But this tool isn&#x27;t leaving you out in the cold after giving you this rating. It
gives also useful advice on how to achieve a better rating. It explicitely tells
you, what you&#x27;re doing wrong and how you can change that.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/rules">The Page Speed Insights <span> ↗</span></a>
shows, which rules for better speed and which rules for better user experience
must be satisfied. I think it&#x27;s a great tool which not only tests everything but
also tells you how you can do better.</p>
<p>Another tool I don&#x27;t want to miss for testing a websites performance is the
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/profile/network-performance/resource-loading">Chrome Dev Tools Network Panel <span> ↗</span></a>.
It:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>&quot;records information about each network operation on a page, including
detailed timing data, HTTP Requests and response headers, cookies and more.&quot;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You just have to open the Chrome Developer Tools (Cmd + Shift + I on a Mac and
Ctrl + Shift + I on Windows) and switch to the Networks Panel. Than just hit F5
to reload and record your pages network activity.</p>
<p><img src="/images/chrome-dev-tools_network-panel.jpg" alt="a gif of the chrome devtools network panel"/></p>
<p>I will just explain the core features here, the link above explains the Network
Panel in depth. It is structured in five panes from top to bottom: The Controls
give you the opportunity to change the look and a few functions.</p>
<p>With Filters you can control which resources are displayed in the Request Table.
The Overview shows a complete timeline of when the resources were retrieved.</p>
<p>The Request Table is the most interesting pane in my opinion. It lists every
resource that was retrieved. You can sort it by name, by size, type and so on.
By default it is sorted by the time it was retrieved. Finally the summary tells
about the total number of requests, the amount of data transferred and the
loading times.</p>
<p>So for a quick use of the Network Panel, you can see just in a few seconds how
much requests your pages needs, how much data is transferred, how long it takes
to load and which are the biggest files that need to load longest.</p>
<h3><a name="minify-css/js"></a>Minify CSS/JS Files</h3>
<p>After having multiple ways of testing your websites performance, there are a few
steps one can take to improve it. Minifying the CSS and JS Files is a big step
to achieve it. This means to delete all whitespaces and comments in the files,
so minified files mostly look like all code is standing on one line.</p>
<p>There are multiple online tools who are able to do that. But as I recently
started using Gulp, it does the job for me. The Gulp Plugin
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://github.com/scniro/gulp-clean-css">clean-css <span> ↗</span></a> just needs the original
folder of your CSS file and the final destination and all the minify stuff is
done in the background.</p>
<pre class="mb-12"><code class="hljs language-javascript">gulp.<span class="hljs-title function_">task</span>(<span class="hljs-string">&#x27;minify-css&#x27;</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> (<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> gulp
    .<span class="hljs-title function_">src</span>(<span class="hljs-string">&#x27;assets/css/**/*.css&#x27;</span>)
    .<span class="hljs-title function_">pipe</span>(<span class="hljs-title function_">cleanCSS</span>({ <span class="hljs-attr">compatibility</span>: <span class="hljs-string">&#x27;ie8&#x27;</span> }))
    .<span class="hljs-title function_">pipe</span>(gulp.<span class="hljs-title function_">dest</span>(<span class="hljs-string">&#x27;assets/css&#x27;</span>))
})
</code></pre>
<h3><a name="compress-images"></a>Compress Images</h3>
<p>The same goes with compressing Images. Images take the most space on a websites
weight so compressing them is usually a good idea. I also used a Gulp Plugin to
solve this task, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/gulp-imagemin">imagemin <span> ↗</span></a>, and
saved a lot of space.</p>
<pre class="mb-12"><code class="hljs language-javascript">gulp.<span class="hljs-title function_">task</span>(<span class="hljs-string">&#x27;imagemin&#x27;</span>, <span class="hljs-keyword">function</span> (<span class="hljs-params"></span>) {
  <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> gulp
    .<span class="hljs-title function_">src</span>(<span class="hljs-string">&#x27;assets/img/**.*&#x27;</span>)
    .<span class="hljs-title function_">pipe</span>(
      <span class="hljs-title function_">imagemin</span>({
        <span class="hljs-attr">progressive</span>: <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>,
      })
    )
    .<span class="hljs-title function_">pipe</span>(gulp.<span class="hljs-title function_">dest</span>(<span class="hljs-string">&#x27;assets/img&#x27;</span>))
})
</code></pre>
<p>In Addition to compress the images I&#x27;m always looking for ways to not use
images. Therefore I always try to solve issues with CSS before implementing an
Image. There is so much more that can be done with CSS than ever before. Also
inline SVG is a nice solution and I used this technique a lot throughout making
this website.</p>
<h3><a name="reduce-http-requests"></a>Reduce HTTP Requests</h3>
<p>As shown in the example above with the GQ website having a lot HTTP Requests is
one of the biggest performance pitfalls. Every single request increases the page
load time and additionally some requests need to wait because others have to
finish. One way to solve this problem is to combine files.</p>
<p>For example many developers like to have different CSS files. One for the main
page layout, one with the responsive styles and so on. The same goes with JS
files.</p>
<p>But remembering that every single file is one HTTP request, having a lot of
different CSS and JS files seems to be a really bad idea. So combining all CSS
files into one leads to only one HTTP request.</p>
<p>You can still use different CSS files in the development process as there are
several techniques to combine them for production like the sass <code>@import</code> which,
in contrast to the CSS <code>@import</code> rule, doesn&#x27;t create an additional HTTP
request.</p>
<p>Another way to reduce HTTP requests is to use Image sprites. This technique
includes to create one single image out of all your background images and leads
to, you guessed it, just one HTTP request instead of many. Than you just
position it so that only the preferred image is displayed and the rest is
hidden. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://twitter.com/KittyGiraudel">Kitty Giraudel <span> ↗</span></a> created a little
script called
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="http://dev.edenspiekermann.com/2016/02/10/introducing-spritesh/">spritesh <span> ↗</span></a>
which takes all of your SVG files and creates one sprite automatically. Very
helpful!</p>
<h3><a name="additional-advice"></a>Additional Advice</h3>
<p>At this time this should be common sense. If you have a script implemented into
your website, the page stops whatever it is doing when it reaches the script and
executes it. So putting your script into the head will block the page rendering.</p>
<p>The solution for this problem is putting the script before the closing body tag.
The page will render completely and the script tag loads after the DOM is loaded
so there is no half loaded website or something like this.</p>
<p>There are also a few other solutions to this like the attributes
<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script">async &amp; defer <span> ↗</span></a> but
as they are not combatible with all browsers yet they won&#x27;t work correctly in
every browser.</p>
<p>Another useful tip is to enable Gzip. Gzip makes it possible to recude the size
of your complete website. Gzip works on the server and most hosting providers
will automatically compress your website with Gzip.</p>
<p>So that was my experience with website performance optimization so far. I know
I&#x27;m just at the beginning of the topic and there are a lot more ways to improve
performance so the learning never stops.</p>
<p>If you have got more tips or advices I would really appreciate it, if you share
them with me. Just send me an <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="outgoing-link-trigger hover:border-b-4 hover:border-dotted hover:border-b-primaryColorTwo" href="mailto:marco@marcoheine.com">email <span> ↗</span></a> or reach out

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Where to start?</h3>
<p>For a long time I had the idea in my mind of developing my personal website. If you want to work in any field related to the web, its seems very logical to have your own website.</p>
<p>So I decided to start this project in October 2015. Spoiler: I startet the real development process in February 2016.</p>
<p>I randomly started collecting ideas, things, special features and more, which I wanted to implement into my website. At this point I have to say how important Twitter became for me. Since I started using Twitter and following all these amazing people, I got inspired, got to read new articles on tools and features and I got to see impressive examples of the work of others everyday.</p>
<p>So after a few weeks of collecting and having a long list of cool things my website should include, I got to a point where I decided what color-palette and font I wanted to use.</p>
<p>At the same time I started sketching some layout concepts with pen and paper. As this is &quot;just&quot; a personal website without having an overcomplex layout, this part of the process didn&#x27;t took to long.</p>
<h3>Getting a toe into the water</h3>
<p>As I finished my design, there was a long period where exactly nothing happend. I added a few ideas and improvements here and there, but it wasn&#x27;t a constant development process. I always told myself I needed a few days where I could work on it the whole time and where nothing else would bother me.</p>
<p>But as I was in the second semester in my master at this time and there were a &quot;few&quot; things which prevented my mind of focusing completely on the project. So I worked more on a &quot;roadmap&quot; and on project management than on actually developing.</p>
<h3>Down the Waterfall</h3>
<p>As I knew I would finish my exams at the end of january, I planned to finally develop the website at the start of february. I knew I had a little time off there and this would allow me to focus 100% on the website. So I prepared everything, made to do lists, canceled all appointments and finally started developing at the beginning of february.</p>
<p>My development environment consisted of a 15&quot; laptop connected to a 21&quot; monitor and I worked on my TV via chromecast additionally. I started with the plain HTML files and finished them, before adding any CSS.</p>
<p>I liked the idea of making a website work without any CSS and it teaches a lot about accessibility. I work with Sublime Text using the Monokai Bright Theme with the Source Code Pro Font and for me this is a very pleasant combination.</p>
<p>I developed my website with the principles of mobile first in mind, constantly checking everything on different devices (thanks to family and friends) with different OS/browsers. Also the Chrome Developer Tools Device Mode is an awesome tool to use. While adding CSS to make everything pretty an advice of Sara Soueidan on Twitter for CSS layout troubleshooting made my life a lot easier:</p>
<pre class="mb-12"><code class="hljs language-css">* {
  <span class="hljs-attribute">outline</span>: <span class="hljs-number">1px</span> solid red;
}
</code></pre>
<p>I assume that I was the only person not knowing about this, but I was very thankful for it and it prevented a lot of headaches.</p>
<p>I guess the most visited website during the development process wasn&#x27;t stackoverflow as you would suggest, it was caniuse.com with no doubt. As I moved on in the process I always red about task runners on Twitter and I thought that I should give it a try. So I started using Gulp, used the sass, livereload, clean-css, uglify, and imagemin plugins for this project and it really improved the development process.</p>
<p>The JavaScript on this website so far is really really basic stuff (like DOM Manipulation) and it&#x27;s also the point where I need to improve the most.</p>
<p>After two weeks of developing and one week of testing, debugging and improving, the first version of this website went finally online. You may ask yourself why I&#x27;m even writing about this, as this is just a personal blog/website and nothing really complex.</p>
<p>But for myself it&#x27;s a starting point which I needed to test my knowledge and to prove to myself what I can and can&#x27;t do so far.</p>
<h3>At the horizon</h3>
<p>So I guess for a first version of this project, I&#x27;m very happy with the result. Although so many things on my &quot;want to have list&quot; haven&#x27;t been implemented yet.</p>
<p>What I&#x27;ve learned:</p>
<ul>
<li>I like to make to do lists and not stick to them</li>
<li>setting up my own development environment</li>
<li>the most important things belonging into the <code>head</code></li>
<li>semantic HTML and accessibility</li>
<li>better structuring and organization of CSS files</li>
<li>using new CSS features like flexbox, transforms, transitions, animations</li>
<li>working with (inline) SVG</li>
<li>make mistakes and learn from them</li>
<li>sharpen my skills concerning responsive web design</li>
<li>get familiar with preprocessors (Sass) and use it efficiently</li>
<li>work the whole day on a problem without solving it, look at it in the evening and solve it in 2 minutes</li>
<li>using a task runner (Gulp)</li>
<li>improve performance</li>
</ul>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It&#x27;s finally (a)live! My own website and my own domain are now part of this big thing called WWW. I welcome you and I&#x27;m glad you found your way through the web to visit my online appearance.</p>
<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/YEL7FJP6ed008/source.gif" alt="a gif of Dr. Frankenstein, yelling: &quot;It&#x27;s alive!&quot;"/></p>
<p>You may ask yourself who I am and whats the purpose of this website. At first it&#x27;s a place for people to get to know me, learn more about me and to get in touch with me.</p>
<p>You can get to know me on my about site, where I wrote a little bit about who I am, what I can (and can&#x27;t) do and what kind of education I was glad to recieve so far.</p>
<p>Secondly I call this website my own sandbox and big playground.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s a place for me to show my Frontend-Skills with HTML/CSS/JS, try out new tools and technologies and just play around with alle the things which are possible when using web technologies.</p>
<p>According to this you may see this website next to a permanent under construction sign.</p>
<p>I&#x27;ll constantly try out, play around and explore new things. So this is very important for me: If you see anything not working in a particular way, find any bugs or even spelling errors or you have advice for me how to do things better and easier PLEASE feel free to contact me and tell me about it!</p>
<p>I love to learn new things everyday and for a constant improvement it&#x27;s important for me to learn from and with other people.</p>
<p>Here on my blog I will write from time to time about new things I have learned, things I&#x27;m interested in and things that bother me in my everday life.</p>
<p>This may be mostly about Frontend topics. I&#x27;m aware of the fact that others (and better developers, I look up to) already wrote about most of these topics. But I like to write these things anyway to learn and improve and familiarize with them.</p>
<p>So my blog posts may not  show new research results and enlighten your mind whith totally new knowledge all the time.</p>
<p>They will be more like a personal collection and summary of articles, recent tools and technologies concerning a specific topic, mainly to support my own learning process.</p>
<p>Anyway I hope you enjoy your stay here, look around and explore and if you would like to talk to me about Frontend Development I&#x27;ll happy if you drop me an email or reach out to me on Twitter.</p>]]></content:encoded>
