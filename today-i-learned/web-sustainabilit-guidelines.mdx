The
[Sustainability Web Design Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/sustyweb/)
announced the
[Web Sustainability Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/blog/2023/introducing-web-sustainability-guidelines/).
It’s all about _“how to design and implement digital products and services that
put people and the planet first.”_

> This guideline provides best practices and recommendations for reducing the
> environmental impact of web development and design, such as minimizing data
> transfer, optimizing images, using green hosting, and more.

The climate crisis is a real threat, and it’s fantastic that people exist who
care to share their ideas on **how to reduce the impact of our industry**. If
you’ve thought the internet is not a part of the problem, think again.

We are responsible for _“2-5% of global emissions, more than the aviation
industry”._ I want to quote some actions from the
[Web Sustainability Guidelines](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/) you can take
immediately to participate in this.

- Minify Your HTML, CSS, And JavaScript
- Avoid Code Duplication
- EnsureYour Solutions Are Accessible
- Use HTML Elements Correctly
- Choose A SustainableHosting Provider
- Optimize Browser Caching
- Be Mindful Of Duplicate Data.

These are just a few suggestions tailored to a **more environmental friendly
web**. The list is long, and I’m sure everybody will find something they can
apply there. The key takeaway I get from this is **anything you already do to
improve the accessibility of your website and the loading performance is also
good for the environment**.
