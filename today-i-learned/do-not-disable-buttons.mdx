  'Today I learned that disabling buttons is a bad idea. There is a better
  solution to that.'
---

Recently, I stumbled over Kitty Giraudel's article
[On disabled and aria-disabled attributes](https://kittygiraudel.com/2024/03/29/on-disabled-and-aria-disabled-attributes/).
He explains the difference and when to use `disabled` and `aria-disabled`.

It depends on the the **intent** of the button. Here's a suggestion on when to
use `disabled`:

> If you have a form with plenty fields, and some of them become irrelevant
> based on the value of other previous fields, using the disabled attribute
> seems like a good option.

On the other hand, using `disabled` on the submit button for this form is a bad
idea. Instead, using `aria-disabled` is the better solution.

> This way, the button remains discoverable (it can be tabbed to) and
> interactive (it can be used to trigger form validation).

I had to think about this for a moment. It absolutely makes sense but I never
applied it in my projects. When I built forms, I always **disabled the submit
button** when the form was not valid.

Kitty mentions a
[lot of articles backing the point of not disabling buttons](#sources). One that
stood out to me was the article
[Disabled buttons suck](https://axesslab.com/disabled-buttons-suck/) by Hampus
Sethfors. It's from 2017 but still relevant today. Hampus lists a lot of reasons
why disabling buttons is a really bad idea:

- They fool users into clicking
- They are hard to see
- They don't give any feedback
- They give design teams a reason to rush through the error handling
- They make users think
- Disabled buttons disable disabled users

That's a long list of reasons. **But what to do instead?** I always thought to
myself:

> "If I disabled the submit button of my form, users will know for sure, that
> they are not done yet".

The solution is simple. **Don't disable the submit button!** Validate the user
input and show an error message when the user tries to submit the form. Let the
user click the button. Always.
