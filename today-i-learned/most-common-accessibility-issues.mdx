The web is **not accessible**. That’s not new, that’s not what I learned today.
But the amount of accessibility errors did surprise me.

The [WebAIM report](https://webaim.org/projects/million/) states over **50
million errors** in the top one million websites.

Today I learned that all of these errors are **the most basic accessibility
issue**, you can fix so easy:

- low text contrast,
- missing alternative text,
- empty links and buttons,
- missing form labels and missing languages.
