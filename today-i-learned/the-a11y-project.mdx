Today I learned about the a11y project. As you might know a11y stands for accesibility. It has 11 characters that's where the short-hand name comes from.

The a11y project is a community-driven effort to make digital accesiblity easer. They provide a ton of information on their website: <a href="https://www.a11yproject.com/" target="_blank">the a11y project &#8599; </a>.

One of the greatest things they curate is a <a href="https://www.a11yproject.com/checklist/" target="_blank">checklist &#8599;</a>, where you can check your WCAG compliance. I'm gonna use this checklist for every new web project from now on. And it's a shame that I haven't used it before. 

Other than that they provide a big list of <a href="https://www.a11yproject.com/resources/" target="_blank">resources &#8599;</a>, be it books, newsletters, podcasts, talks, different tools or communities where you can participate to digital accessiblity.

So if you want to make the web more accessible, the a11y project seems to be a fantastic starting point to learn more about the fundamentals and principles of accessiblity.
