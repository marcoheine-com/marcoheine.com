This post is not an actual Today I learned because I knew about this tool for
several months. Nevertheless, I want to share it with you because it's a great
tool. I use it almost weekly.

If you ever wondered what tool to use to **improve your images for better
website performance**, you should check out the
[Squoosh App](https://squoosh.app/). The web app allows you to **compress**
images in various formats.

You upload your image and choose the compression settings you want. The Squoosh
App will then compress your image, and you can download it.

It offers a lot of settings, like resizing, choosing the format, quality, etc.
You can also compare the original image with the compressed one with a neat
slider.

One of the best things about Squoosh is if you're worried about **privacy**:
Images always stay on your device since Squoosh does all the work locally.

I use it to compress all the images on my website. I use the WebP format and
resize it to drop all my images below 100kb. So if you haven't already, check
out the Squoosh App and improve your website performance. I totally recommend
it!
