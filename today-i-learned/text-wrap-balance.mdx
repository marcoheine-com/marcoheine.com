  Text-wrap balance is a new way to specify with CSS how lines of text are
  balanced.

If you're working on websites where the content is very flexible, where editors
can add text, for example, via a CMS, you often don't know "the final size, font
size or language of text".

It's hard, especially for headlines, to make two lines consistent in the number
of words per line.

Often it looks weird when a headline breaks on a specific breakpoint and just
one word gets wrapped in the following line.

We always had to use techniques that felt more like hacks to enforce a more
consistent wrap. Using `<br />` tags or `&nbsp;.` Counting the words with
JavaScript and adding `<span>` tags around them.

Very soon, we will have a new CSS property called `text-wrap: balance` that will
help us with this.

To use this CSS property, you will need to apply it like this:

```css
.my-headline {
  max-width: 20rem;
  text-wrap: balance;
}
```

This will ensure that the text is balanced over two lines and that the number of
words stays consistent. At the same time, it does not affect the element's width
and will only affect the words within the element.

Only using this property may not be enough because the text needs to wrap and
therefore needs a max width.

Here's a direct comparison of the same text with and without
`text-wrap: balance`:
![a screenshot showing two headlines, the first one does not wrap nicely, the second does.](/images/text-wrap-balance.webp)

Both have set the same max-width but only the second one has the new property
set. The first one has a weird break where it wraps only one word into the next
line while the second one is balanced over two lines.

Ahmad has a lot of great examples of where this new property could be useful:

[Adam Argyle argues](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/css-text-wrap-balance/)
that balancing headlines is the primary use case for `text-wrap: balance.`

It's currently only available in Chrome Canary and behind a flag. But it looks
promising that we will be able to use this property soon in all major browsers.
