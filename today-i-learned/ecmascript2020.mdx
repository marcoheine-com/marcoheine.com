ECMAScript 2020 was released recently which a brings a lot of cool new features
into the JavaScript language.

My favourites from the new release are

- **dynamic imports**,
- **Optional Chaining**
- and the **Nullish coalescing Operator**.

Check the link at the bottom which lists all new features and has links with
explanations of them.
