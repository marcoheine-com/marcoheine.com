  'Today I learned a lot about browsing the web with assistive technology by
  watching the videos from Tetralogical.'

Recently, I started Sara Soueidan’s course
[Practical Accessibility](https://practical-accessibility.today/). In one of the
first chapters, she talks about **assistive technology**, the different types of
it, and how they’re used.

She suggests heading to the Tetralogical website to watch their videos about
[how people with disabilities use assistive technology to browse a website](https://tetralogical.com/blog/2021/12/24/browsing-with-assistive-technology-videos/).
Of course, I’ve heard of **screen readers** before and already used one to
browse a website. I’ve also used my **keyboard to navigate on a page**.

But their videos show even more assistive technology in usage, like **screen
magnifiers** and **speech recognition**. I recommend heading over there and
watching their videos.

I’ve learned a ton. It helps so much with **building accessible and inclusive
user experiences**, and I always think about it whenever I build a new feature
on a website.
