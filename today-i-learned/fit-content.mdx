  'They property fit-content is super useful if you want to shrink wrap an
  element to its contents.'

If you want to restrict the width of an element to it's content, you may have
used `display: inline-block` or `display: inline-flex`.

By using this, the element will shrink wrap to the content inside of it.

```css
.container {
  display: inline-block;
}
```

This is a valid solution to achieve this requirement. But there is a better way
to do this. Introducing: `width: fit-content`. The great thing about
`width: fit-content` is, that it leaves the `display` property available.

```css
.container {
  width: fit-content;
}
```

So it's not changing the position of the element in the layout, but it's just a
way to restrict the width of the element to it's content. Here is a **Codepen**,
where you can see the usage of it and it's effect:
