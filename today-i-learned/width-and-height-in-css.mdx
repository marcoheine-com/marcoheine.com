  'Width and height in CSS are easy to use but height if often misunderstood.'

There is a **fundamental difference** in how `width` and `height` work in CSS. I
recently stumbled over this blog post
[Width and Heigh in CSS](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2023/width-and-height-in-css/)
by Jim Nielsen in which he talks about the topic. He cites, that he got a great
explanation from Josh in his video
[Secret mechanisms of CSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xt1Cw4qM3Ec).

To determine the `width` of an element, the browser **looks up** the DOM tree
and to determine the height of an element, the browser **looks down** the DOM
tree.

What does that mean?

If you set an element to `width: 100%` it will take the width of its parent. So
it's easy to tell an element to take the full width of the page for example.

But height does not work the same way. A lot of developers don't understand that
setting an element to `height: 100%` will not make it take the full height of
its parent. It will take the height of its content. So if you have a `div` with
a `p` inside, the `div` will only be as high as the `p` is.

To be honest, I sometimes still use `height: 100%` and then wonder why it's not
working. But now I know why and I hope you do too.
