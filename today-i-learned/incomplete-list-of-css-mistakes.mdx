Today I learned that in the CSS Working Group Wiki exists an<a href="https://wiki.csswg.org/ideas/mistakes" target="_blank">incomplete list of mistakes in the design of CSS &#8599; </a>. If you check out that list you will notice a lot of things you maybe already thought about, why they were designed this way and it does not seem perfect.

The thing is: as the list says in the beginning, these "mistakes" can't be changed, because they would break the whole internet.

Imagine "correcting" one of these mistakes. It would be a breaking change. Some of these design desicions are VERY old, like they exist since the origin version of CSS, which was created in 1996. 

I can't even image how many websites would be affected by such a change.
 
So the only thing that is left for us to do here is look at this list, nod your head about the fact that `box-sizing` should indeed be `border-box` by default or `top` and `bottom` `margins` should never have been allowed to collapse and go on with our lifes.
