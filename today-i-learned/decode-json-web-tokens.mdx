Today I learned that there exists this super cool tool which can help you to
decode JSON web tokens. Check it out here: https://jwt.io/

You just copy your encoded JSON web token, paste it into the websites encoded
input section and it automatically decodes it and seperates it into header,
payload and verify signature components.

I think that's super useful and interesting to see.
