If you haven't heard of Lighthouse before, it's a tool that helps you improve
the quality of your website. It's available as a Chrome extension and as a Node
module. It's also integrated into Chrome DevTools.

It's my go-to tool for improving the performance of my websites. I test every a
website with it before I publish it, and I test it regularly after that to make
sure, I don't regress.

[Lighthouse 10](https://developer.chrome.com/en/blog/lighthouse-10-0/) was
released recently and includes some major new features.

One of the most significant changes is that
[TTI (Time To Interactive)](https://web.dev/tti/) is being **removed**
completely. Its 10% score weight is shifting to
[CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)](https://web.dev/cls/) which will then account
for 25% of the performance score.

Here is a comparison of the metrics that are used to calculate the performance
in Lighthouse 8 and Lighthouse 10.

Google explains the removal of TTI as "being overly sensitive to outlier network
requests and long tasks." They say that other metrics are better heuristics and
tend to correlate better to the Core Web Vitals.

The shifted and increased score weight of CLS will **improve the performance the
score of about 90% of all websites**.

Besides the removal of TTI and the increased score weight of CLS, there are two
completely new features in Lighthouse 10.

**Back/forward cache** will be added as a **new audit**. It will navigate away
from the test page, go back to it to see if it's bfcache-able.

[Bfcache](https://web.dev/bfcache/) will restore the page layout and execution
state nearly instantly, improving the user experience dramatically. However, if
the website prevents the browser from restoring a page from bfcache, the audit
will be impacted negatively and list reasons for the failure.

Another new audit is **paste-preventing-inputs**. It will check if users can
paste into any input fields on the page. Before that, there was only a check for
password fields. Paste-preventing is a net-negative user experience and should
be avoided.

Some significant improvements to Lighthouse! They are available in the CLI tool,
right away and they will land in Chrome stable in Chrome 112.
