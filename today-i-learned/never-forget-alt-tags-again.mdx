To make sure you added an alt tag to all your images, you can set a specific CSS
rule, which highlights the images missing an alt tag.

```css
img:not([alt]) {
  filter: blur(5px);
}
```

Addy Osmani explains it on the Twitter Link below. Alt tags are necessary for
visual impaired users, who can not see an image but the screenreader can read
the alt tag to them. So if you leave it out, they have no chance to get any
information from it.
