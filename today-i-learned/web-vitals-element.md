As a frequent reader of <a href="https://www.stefanjudis.com/" target="_blank">Stefan Judis blog &#8599;</a> I often come across the stats in the bottom right of his website. It shows for example the amount of ms for the first and the largest contentful paint of his website. 

I was curious about how he gets or calculates these values. Turns out it's an npm package you can easy implement on your own website. It's called the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/web-vitals-element" target="_blank">web vitals element &#8599; </a>.

It's super cool to see that on your website and it kind of encourages others too to improve their performance and showcase their efforts.
