Today I learned about the tool [Image Carbon](https://imagecarbon.com/). It's a
tool that helps you to calculate the carbon footprint of your websites images.

After entering a URL it will show you the amount of CO2 you could reduce by
optimizing your images. It can achieve that by uisng the
[Sustainable Web Design](https://sustainablewebdesign.org/calculating-digital-emissions/)
model.

It checks every image on your page for the format and the size and tells you how
you could improve on that.

Here are the results for my website:

Reducing your image sizes by compressing them and using better formats is not
only better for your websites performance but also for reducing the carbon
footprint.
