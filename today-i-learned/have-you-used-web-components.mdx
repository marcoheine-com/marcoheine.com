I have **never used** **Web Components** before. I’ve heard of them, for sure.
I’ve seen several blog posts and coding examples about how to build web
applications with them. But I never actually used code that included Web
Components.

I never considered choosing them for a new website instead of React or any other
JavaScript Framework. I always thought: they seemed to be a general approach for
building web applications so we, as developers, wouldn’t need to rely on
independent frameworks anymore. But the point where they would overtake never
came.

Ever wondered why they haven’t succeeded yet? Dave Rupert has a lot to say about
this. He wrote a blog post,
[“If Web Components are so great, why am I not using them?”](https://daverupert.com/2023/07/why-not-webcomponents/)
where he shares his opinion on **why web components haven’t taken over yet**,
and what he’d done differently if he could turn back time.

I’ll summarize his key takeaways here, but make sure you’ll check out his whole
blog post and the included links because reading his take on the topic is super
interesting.

In general, Dave says Web Components have a **marketing problem**. That’s the
biggest problem. This can be broken down into the following points:

- Web Components were designed for framework authors, not the average WordPress
  user. But Framework authors **declined** to use them because their problems
  were already solved otherwise.
- They were marketed as a **Google thing** and a bit too heavy on bashing other
  frameworks and selling Web Components as the only true thing.
- It was hard to convince others to use Web Components without the ability to
  refer to popular products built with them.
- They have been around for a few years but only became indeed **supported
  recently**.
- Their development is **slow**. If you’re waiting for a new feature for them
  available in every browser, you have to wait a couple of years.

Dave made many interesting points, which made me understand better why Web
Components are not there yet where they were supposed to be. I’m curious how
they will evolve in the future!
