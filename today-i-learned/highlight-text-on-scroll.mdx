  upcoming scroll-driven animations.'

Scroll-driven animations are a new technqiue coming to CSS that I'm the most
excited about in years. It allows you to animate elements based on the scroll
position of the page.

The best thing about this is, that it's a new set of APIs that work with the
existing Web Animations API and CSS Animations API.

Most features of it are only available in Chrome so far but I'm sure other
browsers will follow soon.

I'm collecting all the resources I can find about scroll-driven animations and
plan to share a huge blog post about it on how to use them as soon as we have
major browser support.

In a recent blog post, Chris Coyier shares a
[great way to make use of this new technqiue to highlight text on scroll](https://frontendmasters.com/blog/highlight-text-when-a-user-scrolls-down-to-that-piece-of-text/).

He uses the `mark` element to highlight text and then animates the
`background-size ` of it.

```html
<p>
  <mark class="scroll-highlight">Scroll-driven animations</mark> are a new
  technqiue coming to CSS that I'm the most excited about in years. It allows
  you to animate elements based on the scroll position of the page.
</p>
```

```css
mark.scroll-highlight {
  background-size: 100% 100%;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-color: transparent;
  background-image: linear-gradient(purple, purple);

  @supports (animation-timeline: view()) {
    animation: mark-it linear;
    animation-fill-mode: forwards;
    animation-timeline: view();
    animation-iteration-count: 1;
    animation-range: contain 0% contain 25%;
  }
}

@keyframes mark-it {
  0% {
    background-size: 0 100%;
  }
  100% {
    background-size: 100% 100%;
  }
}
```

With this CSS he animates the `background-size` of the `mark` element from 0%
100% to 100% 100% when it's in the viewport. The `animation-range` property is
responsible for that and _starts the animation as soon as the element is fully
in the viewport and finishes it when it's 25% of the way up the currently
viewport_.

Here is a Demo of it on <CodePen id="mdoMQay" title="Home
Scroll Timeline <mark> Element" />.

This looks awesome and I can't wait to use it on my own site!
