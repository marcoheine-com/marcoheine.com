Today I learned that there is a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTML_Sanitizer_API" target="_blank">HTML Sanitizer API &#8599;</a>.

It takes untrusted strings of HTML and sanitizes them to enable a safe insertion
into the DOM.

This is pretty cool as sanitizing strings on the client side previously had to
be done by using a third party module or writing your own functionality for
that.

Every web developer should at least know a little bit about web-security. The
term of XSS, also known as <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Cross-site_scripting" target="_blank">cross-site scripting &#8599;</a>
is one of the most common security issues on the web.

This new Sanitizer API can deal with XSS without any extra configuration.

You just initialize a new Sanitizer object and pass it the untrusted HTML
string.

```js
const sanitizer = new Sanitizer()
const untrustedHTML = '<script>alert("XSS")</script>'
const sanitized = sanitizer.sanitizeFor('div', untrustedHTML)
```

It's important to add that this is still an experimental technology. Which means
it's not available in most modern browsern. You have to set the `experimental`
flag to `true` to use it.

But still it's great to see that standard browser APIs like this will become
available in the future.
