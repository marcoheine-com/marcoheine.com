  Sticky menus are used widely on the web but come with some serious issues. In
  this post I learned about the problems they cause and what to do instead.

If you browse the web, you'll notice quickly that **sticky menus are used
often**. Sometimes I'm happy they're on a website, so I can quickly reach
call-to-action buttons or other important information. But most of the time, it
feels to me that they **take up a lot of space** away, and I intend to
**remove** them.

Seeing them so much in the wild was a validation to me. If implemented this
often, they must be helpful and improve the user experience. But if you think
about it: every website uses cookie banners, e-mail sign-up modals, and other
kinds of overlays, and we all hate them and know it's terrible UX.

So I was curious when I stumbled over this post by Adam Silver:
["The problem with sticky menus and what to do instead."](https://adamsilver.io/blog/the-problem-with-sticky-menus-and-what-to-do-instead/)
He states several well explain arguments on **why to avoid sticky menus and
shares better alternatives**.

His key takeaways, why we should replace them are:

1. **They constantly take up space**
2. **They obscure content**
3. **They break when you zoom in**
4. **They're difficult to access**
5. **Internal page anchors feel broken when clicked twice**
6. **They appear closer than they are**
7. **They obscure links and other focusable elements**

While most are obvious and reasonable arguments, numbers six and seven stood
out. I wasn't aware that sticky menus not only **decrease user experience** in
general but they're also reducing **accessibility** by a lot.

Sticky menus make us think that they are always very close to reach. That might
be true if you're using a mouse. You just move to it and can click. But, ever
tried to navigate to a sticky menu with a keyboard? Oh boy! They are often way
out of the normal document flow and very **hard to reach using the tab key**.

More accessibility problems arise if you're trying to move up the page with your
keyboard. Chances are you reach content that's right below the sticky menus. So
links and other focusable elements are not visible to you because they get
obscured by sticky menus.

Adams's advice on what to do instead is:

- **Keep pages short. This removes the need for a sticky menu**
- **Just let users scroll.**
- **Scrolling is never a problem, is fast, and everyone does it anyway**
- **Instead of putting important CTAs into a sticky menu, put them in a context
  like a CTA at the end of a pricing section**

If you think about implementing a sticky menu, I hope this post helps you to
think again by summarizing Adams's points here and sharing his alternatives.
Because sticky menus can have serious issues!
