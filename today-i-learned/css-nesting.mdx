  CSS Nesting is finally built into the language. No need for a preprocessor
  anymore! In this post, I'll look at the spec and valid selectors.

If you've been working with SCSS, you know that **nesting** in CSS is possible
by using this **extension** of the language.

In SCSS, you could write something like this to style the children of a parent:

```scss
.parent {
  color: red;

  .child {
    color: blue;
  }
}
```

To achieve the same thing in CSS, you would have to write something like this:

```css
.parent {
  color: red;
}

.parent .child {
  color: blue;
}
```

This is not a big deal if you only have one child, but if you have multiple it
can get **messy and very repetitive**.

The W3C worked on a new module to finally **enable CSS nesting without the need
of a preprocessor**.

Their main reason for doing this was to increase the "modularity and
maintainability of CSS stylesheets." Furthermore, they explain their motivation
as follows:

> The CSS for even moderately complicated web pages often includes lots of
> duplication for the purpose of styling related content.

Here's how you can nest CSS without the need for SCSS:

```css
.parent {
  color: red;

  .child {
    color: blue;
  }
}
```

It's the same as in SCSS, so if you're used to that syntax, you don't have to
re-learn a lot!

It's also possible to use relative selectors when using nesting:

```css
.parent {
  color: red;

  &:hover {
    color: blue;
  }

  + .sibling {
    color: green;
  }
}
```

The only thing that's not valid is to use nesting selectors that start with an
**identifier**:

```css
.parent {
  color: red;

  input {
    color: blue;
  }
}
```

You can look at all the valid nestings in the
[specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-nesting-1/#nesting-rules). They also
provided an in-depth explanation of why there is a need for **restrictions** on
nested rule selectors.

I think that's a great addition to the language. If you want to try it out right
away, you can test it in the latest releases of Chrome, Edge, and Safari. You
