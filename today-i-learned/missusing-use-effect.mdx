Today I learned that Reacts `useEffect` is not meant for data fetching and is
not a state setter either!

This questions all my best practices Iâ€™ve applied over the last years since we
got useEffect.

David K. Piano held this amazing talk about
[our wrong understanding of useEffect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ck-e3hd3pKw&)
and what the alternatives are. So, good bye useEffect?

His key takeaways were the following:

- the default behaviour of `useEffect` is an infinite loop
- `useEffect` is not for effects
- `useEffect` is not a lifecycle hook
- `useEffect` is not a state setter
- `useEffect` should actually be called `useSynchronize`, because it's meant to
  synchronize React with external systems
