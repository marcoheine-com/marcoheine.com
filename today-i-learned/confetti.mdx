In a project I worked on recently someone mentioned it would be cool to have
some **confetti** after a **form submission**. I loved this idea and after a
quick research I discovered
[canvas-confetti](https://www.npmjs.com/package/canvas-confetti).

Really cool and easy to use plugin to implement some confetti to celebrate!

If you're working with React, there is even a
[React component](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-canvas-confetti) for this
library.

Here's a small example, where you can see it in action:
