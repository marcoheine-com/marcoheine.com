  automate repetetive tasks in a serverless Environment like on Vercel.

Vercel released [Cron Jobs](https://vercel.com/blog/cron-jobs) recently! That is
pretty cool. It's a feature a lot of people longed for because something like
this was not available yet when using serverless environment like Vercel.

Now you can automate repetetive tasks without having a backend. To get started
with Cron Jobs in Vercel you have to create a `vercel.json` file. Here are some
example Cron Jobs:

```json
{
  "crons": [
    {
      "path": "/api/backup",
      "schedule": "0 0 * * *"
    },
    {
      "path": "/api/weekly-mail",
      "schedule": "0 0 * * 1"
    }
  ]
}
```

Cron Jobs use a specific syntax to determine the time when the job should be
executed. The schedule string consists of five fields separated by spaces. They
stand for minute, hour, day, month and day of the week.

So the first job in the example above will be executed **every day at
midnight**. While the second job will be executed **every Monday at midnight**.

With the Hobby plan you get two Cron Jobs for free which each can be triggered
once per day, while the Pro plan offers 40 Cron Jobs in total with unlimited
usage per day.
