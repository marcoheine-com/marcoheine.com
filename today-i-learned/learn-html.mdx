  'Learn HTML! It is still the foundation of the web and the most important
  language to learn.'
---

This is technically not a "Today I learned" post because I already knew that
knowing semantic HTML is important. This post is more of a reminder to myself
and others that HTML is still the most important language to learn.

So today, I learned that learning and knowing semantic HTML is still important.

Every developer saw these websites where the DOM consists of a bunch of `div`s
and maybe even worked on a website like that themselves. I know I did. And I
wasn't proud of it. But thankfully, we can do better.

This week I stumbled over two blog posts. The first one is
[I'm betting on HTML](https://catskull.net/html.html), which highlights their
favorite HTML elements. The second one is
[A Blog Post With Every HTML Element](https://www.patrickweaver.net/blog/a-blog-post-with-every-html-element/)
by Patrick Weaver in which, as the title says, he uses every HTML element in a
blog post.

I'd like to share my favorite parts of these blog posts here, so let's jump
right in.

The range of input types is amazing. You get so much functionality without any
JavaScript.

### Different input types

<label htmlFor="color">Color:</label>
<input
  id="color"
  type="color"
/>

{' '}

<br />
<label htmlFor="date">Date:</label>
<input
  type="date"
  id="date"
/>
<br />
<label htmlFor="datetime-local">Datetime-local:</label>
<input
  type="datetime-local"
  id="datetime-local"
/>
<br />
<label htmlFor="range">Range:</label>
<input
  type="range"
  id="range"
/>

Built-in datepickers? Come on! Everyone who has ever built a datepicker knows
how much work it is to make it accessible and usable. And here we have it for
free.

### Meter

The `meter` element is also pretty cool.

<meter value="0.5">50%</meter>
<meter value="0.75">75%</meter>
<meter value="1">100%</meter>

Firefox shows them all as green, but Safari shows them as red, yellow, and green
depending on the value.

### Progress

And of course, the `progress` element.

<label htmlFor="progress">Progress:</label>
<progress
  id="progress"
  value="0.85"
>
  85%
</progress>

Make sure you use a label for it. Otherwise, it's not accessible.

### Mark

I've worked with JS libraries just to highlight some text. Did you know that's
possible with HTML? I didn't. What a shame.

<mark>highlighted text</mark>

Quick and reasy way to highlight text without any JS.

### Differences between elements

The difference between `strong` and `b` is also interesting. `strong` is for the
meaning of the text and `b` is for the presentation. So use `strong` if you want
to emphasize the text and `b` if you want to make it bold.

I think the same goes for `em` and `i`. `em` is for single words, and `i` is for
phrases.

### Samp

Have you ever used `samp`? I haven't. I didn't even know it existed until I read
Patrick's blog post. It's used to render the output of a computer program. I
always used `code` for that.

<figure className="flex flex-col">
  <figcaption>A little JavaScript program:</figcaption>
  <code>const name = 'Patrick'</code>
  <code>console.log(`Hello ${name}!`);</code>
  <samp>Hello Patrick!</samp>
</figure>

Looks all the same but the last line is rendered as `samp` instead of `code`.

### Wbr

Another one I have never heard before is `wbr`. It's used to tell the browser
where it can break long words. It's a gread thing to use for long URLs. The
points where it breaks are more clear which makes it more readable compared to
not using `wbr`.

These were the highlights of my weekly HTML digest. I strongly recommend reading
both mentioned blog posts above because they cover a lot more than I did here.
