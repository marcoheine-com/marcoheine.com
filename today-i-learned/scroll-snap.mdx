  Today I learned about how you create a scroll snap effect in CSS with the
  scroll snap properties.

I never was a big fan of Sliders and Carousels. Also, creating them as a
front-end developer was always a pain. So whenever possible, I suggested using
**horizontal scrolling** as an alternative.

Combining it with the `CSS scroll-snap properties` allows us to create **smooth
and precise scrolling experiences**, which is super cool.

To get started, you have to look at the two properties, and how they play
together to make these scrolling experiences.

The first property is
[scroll-snap-type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/scroll-snap-type).
It defines the type of scrolling behavior for the scroll container. It can be
set to `x, y, or both`. The default value is `none`.

for example if you set it to `x`, the scroll container will snap to snap
positions on its horizontal axis only.

The second property is
[scroll-snap-align](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/scroll-snap-align).
It defines the alignment of the snap position relative to the scroll container.
It can be set to `start, center, or end`.

If you set it to `start` for example, the snap position will be aligned to the
left of the scroll container. So every item you scroll by snaps until its left
edge is aligned with the left edge of the scroll container.

So far, the theory. Now let's look at some examples to showcase the different
possibilities for creating these scrolling experiences.

Here is a CodePen with examples of the different scroll snap types and
alignments:

  height="800"
  defaultTab="result"

It's awesome see that we are able to create these scrolling experiences with CSS
only and without any JavaScript.
