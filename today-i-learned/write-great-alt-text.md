Writing good alt text is hard. I get it. But not having any alt text is the
worst you can do. It's still one of the most common accessibility issues on the
web.

In this [blog post](https://jakearchibald.com/2021/great-alt-text/) Jake
Archibald explains how to write great alt text.

The key take aways for great alt text are:

- the context matters
- describing the emotion is important
- not to be afraid of trying

Check out the blog post of Jake, to get better at writing alt texts. I
especially liked one sentence of him at the end:

> "[...] if you're trying to do the right thing, you're almost certainly
> improving the experience for real people."

I think that sums it up perfectly. Now go, write your alt texts!
